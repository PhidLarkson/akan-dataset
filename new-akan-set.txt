I WAS born in in Alsace France into an artistic family

During the evenings Father sitting in his lounge chair would be reading some books about geography or astronomy
Na Papa taa pa twere n’agua mu kenkan asase ho nsɛm anaa ewim nneɛma ho nhoma bi anwummere anwummere
My doggy would be sleeping by his feet and Daddy would be sharing with Mum some highlights from his reading while she was knitting for her family

How much I enjoyed those evenings !	Na m’ani gye anwummere a ɛtete saa no ho kɛse !
Religion played a big part in our lives
Na yɛpɛ nyamesom kɛse
We were staunch Catholics and people who saw us going to church on Sunday morning would say It s nine o clock
Na yɛyɛ Katolekfo amapa na na nkurɔfo a wohu yɛn sɛ yɛrekɔ asɔre Kwasida anɔpa no ka sɛ Abɔ nɔnkron
The Arnolds are going to church
Arnold abusua no rekɔ asɔre
Every day before going to school I went to church
Na mekɔ asɔre anɔpa biara ansa na makɔ sukuu
But because of the priest s misbehavior Mum forbade me to go to church alone
Nanso esiane ɔsɔfo no suban bɔne nti Maame amma me nkutoo ankɔ asɔre bio
I was six years old at the time
Saa bere no na madi mfe asia
After having read only three booklets of the Bibelforscher Bible Students now known as Jehovah s Witnesses my mother started preaching from house to house
Bere a me maame kenkan Bibelforscher Bible Asuafo a mprempren wɔfrɛ wɔn Yehowa Adansefo no nhomawa abiɛsa pɛ wiei akyi no ofii ase kaa asɛmpa wɔ afie afie mu
Dad was upset about that
Eyi haw me Papa
He made it a rule that no religious discussion was to be held in front of me
Ɔhyɛɛ mmara sɛ wɔmmmɔ ɔsom ho nkɔmmɔ biara bere a mewɔ hɔ
No reading of that stuff ! 	 Monnkenkan saa nhoma a mfaso biara nni so no
’
But Mother was so enthusiastic about the truth that she decided to do some Bible reading with me
Nanso na Maame ani gye nokware no ho araa ma ɔne me boom kenkan Bible no
She got a Catholic version of the Bible and read it every morning without commenting on it to obey Dad
Na ɔwɔ Katolekfo Bible nkyerɛase no bi na na ɔkenkan no anɔpa biara a ɔnkyerɛkyerɛ nea ɔkenkan no mu nkyerɛ me de yɛɛ osetie maa Papa
One day she read Psalm Their idols are silver and gold the work of the hands of earthling man
Da bi ɔkenkan Dwom Wɔn ahoni yɛ dwetɛ ne sika nnipa nsa ano adwuma
Those making them will become just like them all those who are trusting in them
Wɔn a wɔyɛ wɔn te sɛ wɔn ara obiara a ɔde ne ho to wɔn so no
She linked it with the second commandment which states You must not make for yourself a carved image
Ɔde toaa mmara asɛm a etia abien no so nea ɛka sɛ Nyɛ ohoni bi mfa ’ no
I immediately got up and destroyed my personal altar I had in my room
Mesɔree ntɛm ara kɔsɛee m’ankasa m’afɔrepon a ɛwɔ me dan mu no
I would go to school and share with my Catholic classmates my daily Bible reading
Mekɔ sukuu a na me ne me mfɛfo sukuufo a wɔyɛ Katolekfo no bom susuw me da biara da Bible akenkan no ho
It caused quite a disturbance at school
Eyi de ɔhaw kɛse baa sukuu hɔ
Very often children would follow me in the street calling me a stinky Jew ! 	Na mmofra taa di m’akyi wɔ abɔnten so frɛ me Yudani bɔmɔne ! 
That was in
Na eyi yɛ
This situation caused my father to check on what I was learning
Saa tebea yi maa me papa yɛɛ nhwehwɛmu wɔ nea na meresua no ho
He got himself the book Creation published by Jehovah s Witnesses
Ɔno ankasa nyaa nhoma Creation a Yehowa Adansefo tintimii no bi
He read it and became a Witness himself !	Ɔkenkanee na ɔno ankasa bɛyɛɛ Ɔdansefo !
As soon as the German army entered France over the Belgium border we began to see swastikas on flags on top of churches even though the French flag still flew over city hall
Bere a German asraafo faa Belgium hye so duu France pɛ na yefii ase huu sɛ wɔde Nasifo frankaa asisi asɔredan ahorow atifi ɛwom mpo sɛ na France frankaa da so ara si kuropɔn mu asa a amanfo hyia wɔ hɔ no so de
The French had closed our Kingdom Hall and banned the work of Jehovah s Witnesses and we were already working underground when the Germans came
Na France aban ato yɛn Ahenni Asa mu abara Yehowa Adansefo adwuma no enti na yɛreyɛ adwuma wɔ sum ase dedaw ansa na Germanfo no reba
But the effort to crush the Witnesses intensified
Na mmɔden a wɔbɔe sɛ wobegu yɛn adwuma no mu yɛɛ den
Two years later at age I was baptized
Wɔbɔɔ me asu mfe abien akyi bere a na madi mfe
One month later September at two o clock in the afternoon the doorbell rang
Wɔ ɔsram biako akyi September awia bere nnɔn abien no yɛn fie pon ano dɔn no bɔe
Dad was due home from work
Na bere aso sɛ Papa ba fie
I jumped up opened the door and ran into his arms
Mesɔre kobuee pon no yɛɛ ɔbarima no atuu
A man behind him shouted Heil Hitler ! 	Ɔbarima bi a ogyina n’akyi teɛɛm sɛ Heil Hitler ! 
Down on my feet again I then realized that the man I had embraced was an SS soldier !	 Hitler Mo ! Migyaee ne mu ɛhɔ na mihui sɛ ɔbarima a meyɛɛ no atuu no yɛ SS sraani bi !
They sent me off to my room and gave my mother a four hour cross examination
Wɔde me kɔɔ me dan mu na wɔde nnɔhwerew anan kobisabisaa me maame nsɛm
As they left one of them shouted You won t see your husband anymore !	Bere a wɔrefi hɔ akɔ no wɔn mu biako teɛɛm sɛ Worenhu wo kunu bio !
You and your child will go the same way ! 	Yɛbɛyɛ wo ne wo ba no nso saa ara ! 
Dad had been arrested that morning
Na wɔakyere me papa saa da no anɔpa
He had had his monthly salary in his pocket
Na wagye ne bosome akatua ma ɛwɔ ne kotoku mu
The SS closed down the bank account and refused my mother a working card a necessary document to get a job
SS asraafo no de wɔn nsa too me papa sika a ɛda sika korabea so na wɔamma me maame adwuma krataa tumi krataa a ɛho hia na ɔde ahwehwɛ adwuma ayɛ no
Their policy now was No means of living for those vermin ! 	Afei na wɔn mmara ne sɛ Momfa asetra mu ahiade nkame saa nkurɔfo a wɔn ho yɛ abufuw no ! 
Persecution at School	Sukuu Ɔtae
During this time the pressures at the college preparatory school I was attending continued to increase
Ɔhaw a na ɛwɔ sukuu no mu kɔɔ so yɛɛ den saa bere yi
Whenever the teacher came to class all students had to stand with outstretched arms and say Heil Hitler
Bere biara a tikya no bɛba sukuu dan no mu no na ɛsɛ sɛ adesuafo no nyinaa sɔre gyina trɛw wɔn nsa mu ka sɛ Hitler Mo
When the priest came for religious education he would come in and say Heil Hitler blessed is the one that cometh in the name of the Lord
Sɛ ɔsɔfo no ba bɛyɛ ɔsom ho nkyerɛkyerɛ a na ɔka sɛ Hitler Mo nhyira ne nea ɔnam Awurade din mu ba
The class would answer Heil Hitler Amen ! 	Na sukuufo no gye so sɛ Hitler Mo Amen ! 
I refused to say Heil Hitler and word of this came before the school director
Manka Hitler Mo no bi na ɛho asɛm koduu sukuu panyin no anim
A warning letter was written stating A student is not submitting to school rules and if no change occurs in a week s time this student will have to leave school
Wɔkyerɛw kɔkɔbɔ krataa bi a na ɛkan sɛ Osuani bi nni sukuu mmara so na sɛ wanyɛ nsakrae wɔ dapɛn biako mu a wobeyi saa sukuuni no adi
It mentioned at the bottom that this letter had to be read to the more than classes
Wɔkyerɛw hyɛɛ krataa no ase sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ me Simone Arnolds mekenkan krataa yi wɔ sukuu adesua adan bɛboro no mu
The day arrived when I was called in front of my class to make my decision known
Ɛda no dui ma wɔfrɛɛ me kogyinaa me mfɛfo sukuufo no anim sɛ menkyerɛkyerɛ nea enti a menka asɛm no bi mu nkyerɛ wɔn
The director gave me five more minutes either to salute or to take my school papers and leave
Sukuu panyin no maa me simma anum sɛ memfa nkyia frankaa no na sɛ manyɛ saa a mensesa me nkrataa nkɔ fie
Those five minutes on the clock seemed an eternity
Saa simma anum no yɛɛ tenteenten maa me
My legs got weak my head felt a fullness my heart was pounding
Me nan gyenee nsɛm pii baa me tiri mu na me koma bɔɔ paripari
The heavy silence of the whole class was interrupted by a strident Heil Hitler with the whole class then repeating it three times
Wɔkaa Hitler Mo kɛse bi maa me mfɛfo sukuufo no nyinaa gyee so akɛse abiɛsa maa ɛdan no mu yɛɛ gyegyeegye wɔ kommyɛ no akyi
I ran to the desk got my papers and ran out
Mituu mmirika kɔɔ me pon ho kɔsesaa me nkrataa na miguan fii hɔ
The following Monday I was allowed to go to another school
Mekɔɔ sukuu Dwoda a edi hɔ no
The director said I could attend on the condition that I wouldn t tell anyone why I had been expelled from the other school
Sukuu panyin no kae sɛ sɛ merenka nea enti a wɔpam me no nkyerɛ obiara de a ɛnde metumi asan aba sukuu
My classmates turned on me calling me a thief a delinquent child saying that was why I was sent away
Me mfɛfo sukuufo no haw me wɔfrɛɛ me ɔkorɔmfo abofra bɔne na wɔkaa sɛ ɛno nti na wɔpam me no
I could not explain the real reason
Na mintumi nkyerɛkyerɛ nea enti a wɔpam me no mu nkyerɛ wɔn
I was seated at the back of the class
Wɔmaa me traa akyiri koraa wɔ sukuu dan no mu
The girl next to me realized I wasn t saluting
Abeawa a na ɔbɛn me pɛɛ no hui sɛ na mennye nkyia no so
She thought I was a French resister
Osusuwii sɛ meyɛ France atuatewfo kuw a ɛsɔre tia Hitler no muni
I just had to explain to her why I refused to heil Hitler According to Acts There is no salvation in anyone else for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved
Twa ara na na etwa sɛ mekyerɛkyerɛ nea enti a mennye Hitler Mo no so mu kyerɛ no Sɛnea Asomafo no Nnwuma kyerɛ no Nkwagye nni obiara mu na nso din foforo nni ɔsoro ase a wɔde ama wɔ nnipa mu a ɛsɛ sɛ wogye yɛn nkwa wɔ mu
’
Only Christ is our Savior
Kristo nkutoo ne yɛn Gyefo
Since heil stands for having salvation by someone I cannot attribute this salvation to any man including Hitler
Esiane sɛ obi a wagye nkwa na Ayeyi ’ fata no nti mintumi mfa saa nkwagye ho ayeyi no mma onipa biara a Hitler ka ho
This girl and her mother started studying the Bible with Jehovah s Witnesses and became Witnesses themselves !	Saa abeawa yi ne ne maame fii ase ne Yehowa Adansefo suaa Bible no na wɔn ankasa nso bɛyɛɛ Yehowa Adansefo !
Underground Activity	Esum Ase Adwumayɛ
During all this time we continued preaching underground
Saa bere yi nyinaa no yɛkɔɔ so kaa asɛmpa no wɔ sum ase
We went out the first Sunday of every month to a place in the mountains where we got the French edition of The Watchtower to translate it into German
Kwasida a edi kan wɔ ɔsram biara mu no na yɛkɔ mmepɔw so ɛhɔ na na yekonya Ɔwɛn Aban a ɛwɔ France kasa mu no bi kyerɛ ase kɔ German kasa mu
Mum had made a special garter belt with a hidden pocket for me to carry The Watchtower
Na maame apam mmeawa atade nhyɛase a aboomu soronko bi ne kotoku a ahintaw wɔ ho a na mede Ɔwɛn Aban sie mu
One day we were stopped by two soldiers and taken to a mountain farm where we were searched
Da bi asraafo baanu bi hyiaa yɛn na wɔde yɛn kɔɔ mmepɔw no so afuw bi mu kɔhwehwɛɛ yɛn ho
I got so sick that they had me go lie in the hay and because of this they never found The Watchtower
Meyaree araa ma wɔmaa me kɔdaa sare no so na esiane eyi nti wɔanhu Ɔwɛn Aban no
One way or another Jehovah always seemed to rescue me
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ Yehowa nam akwan ahorow so gyee me bere nyinaa
One day I got the call to go to a psychiatrist
Da bi wɔfrɛɛ me kɔɔ adwene ho aduruyɛfo bi hɔ
It proved to be two of the SS
Ɛdaa adi sɛ SS asraafo baanu na wɔyɛɛ wɔn ho saa
Other Witness children were there too
Na Adansefo mmofra afoforo nso wɔ hɔ
I was the last one to get called in
Me na mitwa to koraa a wɔfrɛɛ me kɔɔ mu
The two doctors sat behind a table I sat with a bright light shining in my face and the cross examination began
Na nnuruyɛfo baanu no te ɔpon bi akyi na metraa beae bi a na kanea hann bi da m’ani na wofii ase bisabisaa me nsɛm
One doctor would ask me some geographic or historical questions but before I could answer the other came in with questions about the underground work
Oduruyɛfo biako bisabisaa me asase ho nsɛm anaa abakɔsɛm bi nanso ansa na mebua no na ɔfoforo no abisa me yɛn sum ase adwuma no ho asɛm bi
He would also ask for the names of the other Witnesses
Obisabisaa me Adansefo afoforo din nso
I was on the verge of a breakdown when suddenly a phone call interrupted their interrogation
Anka mereyɛ ada nsɛm adi bere a telefon no gyegyei ma wogyaee nsemmisa no
How wonderfully Jehovah s help always came !	Hwɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ sɛ minyaa Yehowa mmoa bere nyinaa !
About a month later our school class was chosen to go to a Hitler Youth training camp for two weeks
Bere bi wɔpaw yɛn sukuu adesuafo kuw sɛ yɛnkɔ Hitler Mmofra ntetee nhyiam nkodi adapɛn abien
I never talked to my mother about that
Manka ho asɛm ankyerɛ me maame da
I did not want her to have to bear any responsibility about my decision not to go there
Na mempɛ sɛ ɔsoa me gyinae a na masi sɛ merenkɔ no ho asɛyɛde biara
Before the day of departure came the school director warned me If on Monday you are not at the railroad station or in my office I will get the police after you ! 	Ade rebɛkye ma yɛakɔ no sukuu panyin no bɔɔ me kɔkɔ sɛ Sɛ woamma keteke gyinabea hɔ anaa me office Dwoda a mede polisifo bɛba abɛkye wo ! 
So Monday morning I passed the railroad station on my way to school
Enti mitwaam wɔ keteke gyinabea hɔ kɔɔ sukuu Dwoda no anɔpa
All my classmates were calling me to go with them but I was determined to go to the director s office
Na me mfɛfo sukuufo no nyinaa refrɛ me sɛ me ne wɔn nkɔ nanso na masi me bo sɛ mɛkɔ sukuu panyin no office
I was late getting there so he assumed I had gone with the others on the train
Mannu hɔ ntɛm enti na osusuw sɛ me ne afoforo no aforo keteke no kɔ
He was furious when he saw me
Bere a ohuu me no ne bo fuwii yiye
He took me into his classroom and made the whole class there suffer for four hours
Ɔde me kɔɔ sukuu dan a ɔkyerɛ ade wɔ mu no mu na ɔmaa sukuufo no huu amane nnɔnhwerew anan
For example he would call each child to the front of the class and rather than handing them their notebook he would slap them in the face with it
Sɛ nhwɛso no na ɔfrɛ sukuufo no mu biako begyina sukuufo no anim na sɛ anka ɔde ne nhoma bɛhyɛ ne nsam no na ɔde pae n’ani so
He would point at me and say She is responsible ! 	Na ɔteɛ ne nsa hwɛ me so ka sɛ Ɔno na wama aba saa ! 
He tried to get the children only ten years of age to turn on me
Ɔbɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛma mmofra a afei na na wadi mfe du no de wɔn anibere asoɛ me so
But at the end of class they came congratulating me because I had kept refusing to sing military songs
Nanso yɛpɔnee no wɔn nyinaa bɛmaa me amo esiane sɛ mepow sɛ mɛto asraafo nnwom no nti
Later I was appointed to sort paper cans and bones
Akyiri yi wɔpaw me sɛ minkoyiyi nkrataa ntonturowa ne nnompe mu mfa emu biara ngugu n’afa
I refused to do that since the cans were used for military purposes
Manyɛ esiane sɛ na wɔde ntonturowa no di asraadi ho dwuma ahorow bi nti
I was beaten and left unconscious
Wɔhwee me araa ma ade tɔɔ me so
Later my classmates helped me back on my feet
Akyiri yi me mfɛfo sukuufo no bɛsɔɔ me mu ma mesɔree
When I returned to school I was surprised to see all the classes standing in the yard around a flagpole about children
Bere a mesan kɔɔ sukuu no ɛyɛɛ me nwonwa sɛ mihui sɛ sukuufo a wɔn dodow bɛyɛ no nyinaa atwa frankaa dua bi ho ahyia
I was put in the middle
Wɔde me kogyinaa mfinimfini
A long description of freedom and the outcome for traitors was given followed by three cries of Sieg heil ! victory and salvation
Wɔkaa ahofadi ne nea ɛbɛba afatwafo so ho nsɛm tenteenten bi na wɔteɛɛm kaa Sieg heil nkonim ne nkwagye mprɛnsa !
The national song was sung with me standing stiff and shivering
Wɔtoo ɔman dwom a na migyina hɔ dinn a me ho repopo
Jehovah supported me I kept integrity
Yehowa boaa me migyinaa me mudi mu
Later upon entering our apartment I found my clothes lying on the bed and a letter saying Simone Arnold is to present herself at the railroad station tomorrow morning
Akyiri yi bere a mekɔɔ yɛn dan no mu no mihui sɛ wɔde me ntade ne krataa bi agu me mpa so a ɛka sɛ Ɛsɛ sɛ Simone Arnold de ne ho kɔkyerɛ wɔ keteke gyinabea ɔkyena anɔpa

The following morning Mother and I were at the railroad station
Ɛda a edi hɔ anɔpa no me ne Maame kɔɔ keteke gyinabea hɔ
Two ladies took me into custody

On the train Mother repeated her counsel as to my behavior
Bere a na mete keteke no mu no Maame kɔɔ so tii suban ho afotu a ɔde maa me no mu mpɛn pii
Always be polite kind and gentle even when suffering injustice

Never be obstinate

It is going to be your schooling for future life

It is Jehovah s will that we undergo trials for our future benefit

In a firm voice Mum made supplication in my behalf Oh Jehovah keep my young girl faithful ! 	Maame de nne a emu da hɔ srɛ maa me sɛ Oo Yehowa boa me babea kumaa yi ma onni nokware ! 
For the last time Mum tucked me into bed and kissed me
Ɛno ne da a etwa to a Maame butuu me so wɔ mpa so few m’ano
Things went fast the following day when we arrived at the penitentiary house without giving me a chance to say good bye to Mum

A girl showed me a bed with a wheat bran mattress

My shoes were taken away and we had to walk barefoot until the first of November
Wogyee me mpaboa fii me nsam na na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn nan sisi fam araa kosi November da a edi kan
The first noon meal was hard to swallow

I was given six pairs of socks to mend otherwise I couldn t get any food
Wɔmaa me sɔks asia sɛ mempempam mmeae a atete no sɛ mansiesie a wɔmma me aduan nni
For the first time I started crying
Nea edi kan no misui
Tears made those socks wet

My bed was bloodstained my periods had started shortly before this

Trembling I went to the first teacher I came across Miss Messinger
Bere a na ehu aka me no mekɔɔ tikyani a midii kan hyiaa no Awuraa Messinger hɔ
She called a girl who showed me how to wash my sheet in cold water
Ɔfrɛɛ abeawa bi ma ɔkyerɛɛ me sɛnea mɛhoro me mpasotam no wɔ nsunwunu mu
The stone floor was cold and the pains got stronger
Na ɛfam hɔ a wɔde abow asɛm no yɛ nwunu na me yawdi no mu yɛɛ den
I began to cry again
Mifii ase sui bio
Then Miss Messinger said with a caustic smirk Tell your Jehovah he should wash your sheet ! 	Afei Awuraa Messinger de serew kae sɛ Ka kyerɛ wo Yehowa no na onsi wo mpasotam mma wo ! 
That was just what I needed to hear
Ɛno ara ne nea na mepɛ sɛ mete
I dried my eyes and never were they able to get me to shed tears again

I got to clean Miss Messinger s room

She demanded that I go under the bed every day to clean the springs
Ɔhyɛe sɛ minwura ne mpa no ase da biara nkɔpopa nnade a ɛbeabea mpa no mu no ho
I had a little Bible that I had smuggled into the house and I was able to wedge this into the springs

Thereafter I was able to read parts of the Bible every day

The Protestant girls went to their church on Sunday and the three Catholic girls to theirs but I had to do the cooking for all children

For our four teachers I had to cook meat bake cakes and prepare vegetables

Several months later with obvious pleasure Miss Messinger gave me the news that dear Mum had been arrested and was in a concentration camp

At least my mother knew where I was but when she came to get me I did not recognize her

Little wonder from what she had been through !	Esiane tebea ahorow a na wafa mu no nti na ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa
When Mum was arrested she was sent to the same camp where Daddy had been sent Schirmeck except she was put in the women s camp
Bere a wɔkyeree maame no wɔde no kɔɔ adwumayɛban a na Papa wɔ no ara Schirmeck nanso wɔde no kɔɔ mmea mu

Next to contaminate her she was moved in with women who had syphilis

While being moved to Ravensbruck she became very weak with a cough

At that time the Germans fled and the prisoners en route to Ravensbruck were suddenly free my mother among them

Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ Constance beae a na mewɔ no nanso atuo bi a wɔtoto fii wimhyɛn mu maa biribi twaa n’anim na mogya tuu no

I had been trained to bow down in front of visitors and show them all my work the embroideries the sewing because some ladies came to the home to get a maid

And that is the way I treated poor Mum !	Na saa na meyɛ kyerɛɛ me Maame !
Only when she took me to a judge to get the legal right to take me home did the realization dawn on me that this was my mother !	Ɛyɛ bere a ɔde me kɔɔ ɔtemmufo no hɔ sɛ ɔrekogye tumi krataa de me akɔ fie no ansa na merehu sɛ ɔyɛ me maame !
All at once the tears I had kept inside of me for the past months burst out

As we left the statement of the director Miss Lederle was like soothing oil to Mum
Bere a yɛrefi hɔ no asɛm a ofie hɔ panyin Awuraa Lederle kae no maa Maame koma tɔɔ ne yam
She said I give your girl back to you in the same mental attitude she came

My integrity was still intact

The only thing that still saddened us was that Dad was missing
Ade biako a na ɛda so hyɛ yɛn awerɛhow ne sɛ na Papa ayera
He was listed as dead by the Red Cross

In the middle of May there was a knock at the door

A friend Maria Koehl was at the door and she said Simone I m not alone
Na ɛyɛ adamfo bi Maria Koehl na ogyina ɔpon no ano na ɔkae sɛ Simone ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na mebae
Your father is downstairs

He passed right by me and went straight to Mum !	Osian me ho kɔɔ me maame hɔ tee a wanhu me !
The spontaneous little year old girl he had once known had grown to be a shy young teenager during those long months
Na abeawa a wadi mfe a na ɔyɛ ade ahopere so no anyin abɛyɛ ababaa a ɔfɛre ade wɔ asram pii a wɔn ntam tetee no mu

He was later used in medical experiments

From Dachau he was sent to Mauthausen an extermination camp worse than Dachau where he suffered hard labor and beatings and was set upon by police dogs

But he had survived and was finally here at home once more

When I became I went into the full time service as a minister of Jehovah s Witnesses and then to Gilead in the United States the Watch Tower Society s school for missionaries

A Day in the Life of a Butterfly	Nea Afofantɔ Yɛ Da Biara
IF YOUR daily routine seems stressful and difficult spare a thought for the hardworking butterfly
SƐ WOTE nka sɛ da biara da adwuma a woyɛ yɛ den na ɛma wobrɛ a gye bere susuw afofantɔ a ɔyɛ adwumaden no ho
At first you may think that a butterfly s work schedule looks like a dream vacation
Nea edi kan no ebia wubesusuw sɛ afofantɔ adwuma yɛ anigye
Flitting from flower to flower supping a little nectar here and there basking at will in the sunshine the butterfly appears to be the epitome of the carefree life style
Bere a otu fi nhwiren biako so kɔ ɔfoforo so kɔ mmeae mmeae kɔnom nhwiren mu nsu nkakrankakra to awia bere biara a ɔpɛ no ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo sɛ afofantɔ asetra yɛ ahotɔ nkoaa
But in the insect world things are not always what they seem
Nanso nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw bere nyinaa wɔ nkoekoemmoa asetra mu sɛnea ebia wususuw sɛ ɛte no
Butterflies are busy creatures who perform a vital service while constantly working against the clock
Mfofantɔ yɛ mmoa a wonni adagyew koraa a wɔyɛ nnwuma pa na wɔde ahopere yɛ adwuma te sɛ nea ɛbere retia wɔn
Let s join a butterfly on a typical workday
Momma yɛnhwɛ adwuma a afofantɔ yɛ da biara
A Sunshine Breakfast	Ɔto Awia Anɔpa
Do you wake up feeling groggy ?	So wosɔre anɔpa a woyɛ mmerɛw ?
Early morning blues are endemic among butterflies
Mfofantɔ taa yɛ kyɛkoo anɔpa
Some mornings they can t get going at all literally
Ɛtɔ da bi a wontumi ntu anɔpa koraa
Their problem is body temperature which fluctuates according to their surroundings
Wɔn haw no ne wɔn honam mu hyew a ɛsakra sakra ma ɛne beae a wɔwɔ hyia no
After they spend a cold night perched on a leaf their blood is so cold they can hardly move much less fly
Bere a wɔada ahaban bi so anadwo wɔ awɔw mu ma ade akye no wɔn mogya yɛ nwunu ma ɛyɛ den sɛ wɔbɛkeka wɔn ho nkantom sɛ wobetu
So they must wait for the sun
Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔtwɛn ma owia pue
When the sun rises the butterfly opens his wings and angles them toward its warming rays
Sɛ awia pue a afofantɔ bue ne ntaban mu de kyerɛ owia hann no
The outstretched wings acting like miniature solar panels soon capture the necessary heat and off the butterfly sails
Ne ntaban a watrɛw mu no di dwuma te sɛ afiri bi a ɛkyere owia mu hyew na ɛkyere ɔhyew a ehia no ntɛm so na afofantɔ no tu
But what if the sky is cloudy ?	Na sɛ ɛba sɛ ewim yɛ kusuu ɛ ?
In cool temperate regions butterflies must stay put immobilized on a convenient twig or flower until the sun shines
Wɔ mmeae a ewim yɛ nwunu a awia mmɔ kɛse no ɛsɛ sɛ mfofantɔ sisi faako abaa anaa nhwiren a ɛfata so kosi sɛ awia bɛbɔ
This is not laziness
Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ wɔyɛ akwadworɔ
It s sheer necessity
Ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia ankasa
If the day is not too hot the butterfly pauses from time to time for further sunshine therapy
Sɛ ɛda no mu nyɛ hyew kɛse a afofantɔ gyina bere ne bere mu to awia kakra ma ne ho yɛ hyew
Like a car refueling at a gas station he needs his fill of solar energy
Sɛnea kar pɛtrol sa a ɛkɔ beae a wobu pɛtrol san kobu bi no saa ara na sɛ afofantɔ hia honam mu ɔhyew a ɔkɔto awia
In the tropics the butterfly may need to bask only first thing in the morning or after a shower of rain
Wɔ mmeae a awia bɔ na nsu tɔ kɛse no ebia ɛho behia sɛ afofantɔ to awia anɔpa anaa bere a nsu atɔ akyi
Generally speaking the cooler the weather the more time he spends basking
Sɛ yɛbɛka a dodow a ewim yɛ nwunu no dodow no ara na ɔto awia
Once his energy is restored he continues with the work at hand
Sɛ ɔsan nya honam mu ahoɔden pɛ a ɔtoa n’adwuma a ɛwɔ sɛ ɔyɛ no so
Love at First Scent 	 Ehua a Edi Kan a Enya ne Dɔ ’
The most urgent task is to find a mate
Adwuma a ɛyɛ den koraa ne ɔhokafo a obenya
With a life expectancy that rarely exceeds a few weeks there is no time to lose
Esiane sɛ ne nkwa nna yɛ adapɛn kakraa bi nti ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhwehwɛ ɔhokafo ntɛm so
And finding a mate in the butterfly world is no easy job it requires heroic patience and persistence
Na ɔhokafo a afofantɔ hwehwɛ no nyɛ adwuma a ɛda fam egye abotare ne animia
Love at first sight is unknown among butterflies
Ɛnyɛ mfofantɔ su ne sɛ wobehu ɔfoforo prɛko pɛ anya ɔdɔ ama no
They are notoriously nearsighted and more often than not they mistake a different species for one of their own
Wɔyɛ mmoa a wonhu ade a ɛwɔ akyiri yiye koraa na mpɛn pii no wodi mfomso fa mfofantɔ afoforo bi sɛ wɔn sɛso
This leads to many a fruitless chase that comes to naught when the butterfly suitor finally realizes his eyes have deceived him
Eyi ma mpɛn pii no afofantɔ a ɔrepɛ ɔhokafo no tu di mfofantɔ afoforo akyi a mfaso nni so na awiei koraa no sɛ obehu sɛ nea ohui no nyɛ ɔbere a ofi n’abusua mu a ɔsan
To make life even more difficult the female usually isn t receptive
Nea ɛma asetra no mu yɛ den koraa no ɔbere no ntaa mpene so mma no
The ardent male flies persistently around her in a type of high speed aerial waltz hoping that she will eventually relent
Afofantɔ nini a n’ani yɛ den no kɔ so tu twa ne ho hyia a ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ awiei koraa no ɔbɛpene so
But these spectacular butterfly ballets usually come to an abrupt end when the female flies off leaving the hapless male to continue his search
Nanso ɛtaa ba sɛ saa mfofantɔ asaw a ɛyɛ fɛ yi ba awiei mpofirim bere a ɔbere no tu kɔ no na ogyaw afofantɔ nini a ne ti anyɛ yiye no ma ɔtoa ne hokafo hwehwɛ no so
Surprisingly enough the female isn t that fussy about the fancy colors of her male consort
Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye ne sɛ ɔbere no ani nnye ne hokafo nini no honam a atoto fɛfɛɛfɛ no ho
Although Darwin blithely assumed that butterflies brilliant colors provided some evolutionary advantage the evidence has not been forthcoming
Ɛwom sɛ Darwin susuwii sɛ mfofantɔ kɔla a ɛyɛ fɛ no ma wonyaa adannandi ho nnyinasosɛm bi de ’ nanso wonnyaa adanse biara a wɔde begyina akyi sɛ ɛyɛ nokware
In one experiment females of the North American species Anartia amathea mated quite happily with males whose bright crimson and black wings had been painted black all over
Wɔ nhwehwɛmu bi a wɔyɛe wɔ Atifi fam Amerika mfofantɔ Anartia amathea ho mu no wɔde kɔla tuntum kaa anini no ho nanso wotumi ne abere hyiae anigye so
What seems to matter most is the male s flight pattern his persistence and above all the unique love dust
Na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nea ɛyɛ biribi titiriw ara ne sɛnea onini no tu na ɔkɔ so di ɔbere no akyi ne nea ɛsen ne nyinaa no ne dɔ pawda soronko no
The love dust carries a pheromone that is the male s trump card
Biribi a ɛyɛ huam a ɛma onini no nya ɔbere no wɔ ɔdɔ pawda no mu
It is a heady perfume tailor made to affect the females of his species
Ɛyɛ sradehuam a ano yɛ den a ɛfata a ɛtwetwe abere no
During courtship he attempts to dust her with this superscent
Wɔ bere a wahu ɔbere no foforo no ɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛtow pawda huamhuam soronko yi ahura no ho
Although the love dust is no guarantee of success it works wonders when a willing female is finally found
Ɛwom sɛ yentumi nka sɛ ɛyere so dɛn ara a ɔdɔ pawda yi bɛma wadi nkonim de nanso etumi di dwuma yiye bere a awiei koraa no ohu ɔbere a ɔpene so ma no no
A Taste of Nectar	Nhwiren mu Nsunom
All the energy expended in this search for a mate must be replenished
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhyɛ ahoɔden a ɔsɛe no wɔ ɔhokafo hwehwɛ mu no nyinaa ananmu
Hence the butterflies taste for nectar
Enti mfofantɔ nom nhwiren mu nsu
Flowers advertise this high energy food by means of attractive shapes and colors
Nhwiren nam ne hwɛbea ne ne kɔla ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ so bɔ saa aduan a ahoɔden wom kɛse yi ho dawuru
Once he alights on the flower the butterfly deftly sucks up the nectar with a long tubelike proboscis which he pokes into the base of the flower
Sɛ afofantɔ si nhwiren so pɛ a ɔde biribi feaa a etua n’ano te sɛ paane no wura nhwiren no mu kosi ase twe mu nsu no ahokokwaw so
While feeding on the nectar the insect gets a dusting of pollen on his hairy body thus taking the pollen with him to the next flower he visits
Bere a ɔnom nhwiren no mu nsu no nhwiren no so pawda a ɛma nhwiren tumi pae no hura akoekoeboa no honam a ɛho wɔ nhwi no ho enti ɔde pawda a ɛwɔ ne ho no kɔ nhwiren foforo so
During a typical workday hundreds of flowers are pollinated
Afofantɔ ma nhwiren ɔhaha pii nya nea ɛbɛma atumi asow aba wɔ ne da koro adwumayɛ mu
In tropical forests however flowers do not abound
Nanso nhwiren nnɔɔso wɔ kwae a ɛwowɔ mmeae a awia bɔ na nsu tɔ kɛse no mu
What do tropical butterflies usually drink ?	Dɛn na mfofantɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ no nom ?
Tropical butterflies like nothing better than gorging on rotten fruit
Mfofantɔ a ɛwowɔ mmeae a awia bɔ na nsu tɔ kɛse no mpɛ biribiara nsen nnuaba a aporɔw mu nsu a wɔnom no
The overripe fruit that falls to the ground provides them a plentiful source of sugary energy
Aduaba a abere aporɔw a ɛte tɔ fam no ma wonya nsu a asikre ahoɔden wom no pii
Butterflies also like salt
Mfofantɔ pɛ nkyene nso
They may often be found sucking up the salty moisture from a patch of wet ground or occasionally the perspiration on the hand of a human admirer
Wotumi hu wɔn sɛ wɔnom fam nsu anaa ɛtɔ da bi a fifiri a efi onipa a ɔkyerɛ ne ho anigye ma osi ne nsa so no
The intrepid flambeau butterfly has even been spotted drying the tears of the caiman
Wɔahu afofantɔ a n’ani yɛ den a onsuro ade sɛ ɔrenom mampam ani ase nsu a ɛyɛ nkyenkyene no mpo
While busily looking for a mate pollinating flowers and keeping well fed our winged friend must also keep an eye out for enemies
He may look defenseless but he has several tactics to avoid capture
Bere a onni adagyew a ɔhwehwɛ ɔhokafo de aba nketenkete bi gugu nhwiren so na atumi apae na odidi no ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn adamfo a ɔwɔ ntaban no yɛ ahwɛyiye wɔ atamfo ho nso
Keeping Danger at Bay A gaudy butterfly fluttering over a meadow would presumably be a tempting morsel for any insect eating bird
Ebia anomaa biara a odi nkoekoemmoa bɛbɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛsɔ afofantɔ a n’ani agye a ɔredi akɔneaba wɔ sare so adi
But the butterfly s haphazard jerky flight makes catching him a very tricky job
Nanso tu a afofantɔ ntu nkɔ n’anim tee na ɔkɔ soro ba fam dannan ne ho no ma ɛyɛ den sɛ wɔbɛkye no
Most birds give up after a few tries
Nnomaa pii gyae n’akyi di bere a wɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkye no akyi bere tiaa bi
Even when a bird does catch a butterfly the insect may succeed in escaping by leaving behind a portion of his wing in the bird s beak
Na sɛ anomaa kyere afofantɔ mpo a akoekoeboa yi tumi guan denam n’ataban no fa bi a ogya ma ɛka anomaa no ano no so
Eyesight is another protection
N’ani nso ne ade biako a ɛbɔ ne ho ban
Although butterflies are nearsighted their compound eyes are highly efficient at detecting movement
Ɛwom sɛ mfofantɔ nhu ade a ɛwɔ akyiri yiye de nanso wɔn aniwa tumi hu biribi a ɛkeka ne ho ntɛm
They will dart away at any hint of danger as anyone who has tried to photograph a butterfly knows only too well
Sɛ ɔte asiane ho mpopoe ketewaa bi a otu guan sɛnea obiara a wabɔ mmɔden sɛ obetwa afofantɔ mfonini pɛn nim no yiye no
Some slow flying butterflies have another safety device their nasty taste
Mfofantɔ a wotu brɛoo no bi wɔ ade foforo a ɛbɔ wɔn ho ban wɔn nam nyɛ dɛ
It is caused by their feeding on poisonous plants when they were caterpillars
Nea ɛde eyi ba ne afifide bi a awuduru wom a na wodi bere a na woyɛ asa no
Once he has bitten such a butterfly a bird will usually shy away from a second encounter
Sɛ anomaa bi sɔ afofantɔ a ɔte saa pɛ a ɔmmɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa ne mprennu so
Often these foul tasting butterflies like the monarch are brightly colored a visual warning that apparently reminds the bird to keep clear
Mfofantɔ a wɔnyɛ dɛ yi te sɛ biako bi a wɔfrɛ no monarch no kɔla hyerɛn na ɛyɛ ade a ɛbɔ anomaa kɔkɔ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔkye no
Journey s End	Ne Nkwa Nna
The World Book Encyclopedia notes that most butterflies do not live longer than a few weeks but that some species may live up to months
The World Book Encyclopedia ka sɛ mfofantɔ pii nkwa nna yɛ adapɛn kakraa bi pɛ nanso wɔn mu bi tumi di asram ansa na wɔawuwu
Some are dormant during the cold winter months or during a prolonged dry season in the tropics
Ebinom ntumi nnyin wɔ awɔw bere mu wɔ mmeae a awia mmɔ kɛse anaa ɔpɛ bere a ɛkyɛ mu wɔ mmeae a awia bɔ kɛse
But despite their short lives butterflies can accomplish amazing feats
Nanso ɛmfa ho wɔn nkwa nna a ɛyɛ tia no mfofantɔ tumi yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa
Last century the monarch butterfly crossed the Atlantic in sufficient numbers to establish itself in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa
Afeha a etwaam no mu no afofantɔ a wɔfrɛ no monarch pii bi twaa Atlantic Po no kɔtraa Canary Islands supɔw bi a ɛbɛn Afrika mpoano no so
Another great traveler the painted lady regularly journeys from North Africa to the north of Europe in the summer season
Ɔkwantufo kɛse foforo a wɔfrɛ no painted lady taa tu kwan fi Afrika Atifi fam kɔ Europa atifi fam ahohuru bere mu
During their brief life span the tireless butterflies do a vital job pollinating flowers shrubs and fruit trees

And much more than that their presence adds a touch of beauty and delight to the countryside

CUTLASS in hand Janyere hacks his way through the overgrown cassava plot

A straw hat shades him from the blistering equatorial sun

Some experts say that by the year the number of people dependent on cassava may double the number of those who relied on it during the mid s
Animdefo bi ka sɛ ebetumi aba sɛ ebedu afe no na nnipa a wodi bankye no dodow ayɛ wɔn a na wodi wɔ mfinimfini hɔ no mmɔho abien
Have you eaten cassava ?	So woadi bankye pɛn ?
If you live in a temperate area of the earth you may say no
Sɛ wote asase yi fa a awia mmɔ hɔ pii a ebia wobɛka sɛ dabi
But do not be so sure !	Nanso nka sɛ wunnii bi koraa da !
Cassava starch is an important ingredient in sauces gravies baby foods mustards tapioca products thickening agents confectionery and bread

In addition to its contribution to the food industry cassava is used in making adhesives pastes and paints

Growing It Is Easy	Ne Dua Nyɛ Den
But for most Africans such as Janyere and Ngozi cassava is grown to be eaten
Nanso wɔ Afrikafo dodow no ara te sɛ Janyere ne Ngozi fam no di a wobedi nti na wodua bankye
Though low in protein its bulky tubers are rich in carbohydrates
Ɛwom sɛ nnuan mu ahoɔden a wɔfrɛ no protein a ɛwom sua de nanso nnuan mu ahoɔden a wɔfrɛ no carbohydrate wɔ n’aduan a ɛbɔ akɛse no mu yiye
Pound for pound cassava packs more than two and a half times as many calories as either maize or yam Africa s next two most important staple foods
Sɛ yɛbɛka a Calorie a ɛwɔ bankye mu dɔɔso koraa sen nea ɛwɔ aburow anaa bayerɛ a ɛyɛ Afrikafo nnuan atitiriw abien a edi hɔ
Its young shoots and leaves are good to eat high in vitamins minerals and proteins
Wodi ne nnua ne ne nhaban a afifi foforo no nnuan mu ahoɔden a wɔfrɛ no vitamin mineral ne protein wom kɛse
One big factor contributing to the importance of cassava is that it is so easy to grow
Ade titiriw biako a ama nnipa pii ani agye bankye ho kɛse ne sɛ ne dua nyɛ den
No extensive land preparation is required other than removing shrubs and vines and making sure that there is some sunlight
Enhia sɛ wɔyɛ asase no so adwuma kɛse pii nea wɔyɛ ara ne sɛ wɔdɔw wura ne nhama a ɛwowɔ asase no so ma awia bɔ so
When the soil is moist the farmer plants stem cuttings from which the cassava will grow
Sɛ nsu tɔ ma asase no fɔw a okuafo no dua bankye nnua a wɔatwitwa no asinasin no
It doesn t require a lot of weeding and it needs little or no fertilizer fungicide or insecticide
Enhia sɛ wɔdɔw ho pii na fɛtilasa fungucide aduru a ɛhyew ntuw anaa nnuru a wɔde kunkum mmoawa mmoawa kakraa bi na ehia anaa enhia mpo sɛ wɔde bi di dwuma koraa
It also can be harvested at any time of the year
Wotumi tu bankye nso wɔ afe no mu bere biara
Cassava is amazingly hardy
Bankye yɛ afifide a etumi gyina tebea horow pii ano ma ɛyɛ nwonwa
It grows well in good soil and in poor
Etumi nyin yiye wɔ asase pa ne nea enye nyinaa so
It thrives from sea level up to altitudes of feet m
Etumi yɛ yiye wɔ asase a ɛda fam ne mmepɔw nyinaa so
It flourishes in areas of heavy rainfall but it is also fruitful in climates where there is no rain for nine months of the year
Etumi yɛ yiye wɔ mmeae a nsu tɔ kɛse na etumi yɛ yiye wɔ mmeae a nsu ntɔ wɔ hɔ asram akron wɔ afe mu nso
Even if a fire should burn it to the ground cassava sprouts afresh from its base !	Sɛ ogya hyew bankye ma ɛka n’ase koraa mpo a etumi fifi bio !
Processing It Is Hard Work	Ɛho Adwuma Yɛ Den
So from the time it is planted until the harvest cassava is relatively labor free
Enti bankye ho adwuma nyɛ den pii fi bere a wodua araa kosi bere a wotu
Once it is out of the ground however the real work begins
Nanso sɛ wonya tu a na adwumaden no ankasa afi ase
In fact the work involved from harvest to dinner table may equal or surpass all preharvest activities
Nokwarem no ebia adwuma a wɔyɛ wɔ ho fi bere a wɔatu kosi bere a wodi no yɛ den sen efi ne dua so kosi ne tu so anaasɛ ɛbɛkyɛn saa
This work must begin quickly
Ɛsɛ sɛ wofi saa adwuma yi ase ntɛm
Had he wanted to Janyere could have stored the cassava tubers for up to two years by simply leaving them unattended in the ground
Sɛ na Janyere pɛ a anka obetumi agya bankye no wɔ fam ma adi bɛyɛ mfe abien a ɔnyɛ ho hwee
But once they are uprooted the tubers must be processed within hours or they will begin to rot
Nanso bere a wɔatu no de ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde yɛ biribi wɔ nnɔnhwerew mu anyɛ saa a ebefi ase asɛe
Ngozi wants to make gari a favorite of Nigerians
Ngozi pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ gari aduan a Nigeriafo pɛ yiye
First she peels the cassava with a knife then she washes it
Odi kan de sekamma sinsen bankye no afei ɔhohoro ho
Ngozi and Janyere now take the peeled cassava to their friend Alex who has a grinder
Afei Ngozi ne Janyere de bankye a wasinsen no kɔ wɔn adamfo Alex a ɔwɔ afiri a wɔde yam ade hɔ
The grinder mashes the tubers into pulp
Afiri a wɔde yam ade no twiw bankye aduan no ma ɛyɛ mmɔre
The pulp is then put in a porous sack and the liquid is squeezed out in Alex s press
Owie a wɔde bankye a wɔatwiw no gu kotoku a ntokuro deda ho mu na Alex afiri a wɔde kyi ade no kyi bankye a wɔatwiw no mu nsu
But the work is not over yet !	Nanso na wonnya nwiee adwuma no !
Next the cassava pulp must be dried for several days
Nea edi hɔ no ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhata bankye a wɔatwiw no nna pii
Janyere then sifts it with a raffia sifter
Afei Janyere de tonton ahuhude po so
After that Ngozi fries it turning it over with a wooden plate so that it does not burn
Ɛno akyi no Ngozi kyew ɔde koraa sin bi nunu mu dannan no sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛrenhyew
The cassava having reached this stage of processing is now called gari
Sɛ wɔyɛ bankye no ho adwuma duru ha a wɔfrɛ no gari
Though Ngozi has chosen just one of many ways to process her cassava most cassava in Africa is processed by women at farm or village level
Ɛwom sɛ Ngozi apaw akwan pii a wɔnam so di bankye ho dwuma no mu biako pɛ de nanso mmea de wɔn nsa yɛ Afrika bankye dodow no ara ho adwuma wɔ fie
Shortcuts are not advisable since cassava contains small quantities of cyanide highly poisonous to humans and animals
Esiane sɛ cyanide a ɛyɛ awuduru kɛse ma nnipa ne mmoa kakra wɔ bankye mu nti ɛsɛ sɛ wodi ho dwuma yiye
Thorough processing reduces the cyanide content to a safe level
Ɛho dwuma a wodi no yiye tew cyanide dodow a ɛwom no so ma ɛka ketewaa bi a ɛnyɛ hu
Dinnertime !	Adidi Bere !
Now at last it is time to eat !	Afei adwuma no nyinaa akyi no ɛbere aso sɛ wodidi !
Gari mixed with coconut milk makes a delicious pudding
Gari a wɔde kube mu nsu a wɔakyi afra yɛ aduan a ɛyɛ dɛ
It can also be made into biscuits
Wotumi de yɛ bisket nso
But Ngozi and Janyere decide instead to eat eba which is made by simply stirring the gari into hot water
Nanso Ngozi ne Janyere si gyinae sɛ wobedi eba gari fufuo a wɔde gari gu nsuhyewo mu ka ara kwa no
Throughout Africa cassava dishes are as varied as the names given them
Bankye nnuan ne din ahorow a wɔde frɛ no dɔɔso wɔ Afrika nyinaa
In Cote d Ivoire it is served up with meat and vegetables as attieke
Wɔde ɛnam ne nnuadewa ka bankye ho di wɔ Cote d’Ivoire sɛ akyɛka
In Ghana cassava combined with fish or egg sauce makes a one dish meal called garifoto
Wɔde mpataa anaa nkesua abom ka gari ho yɛ garifotɔ wɔ Ghana
In Tanzania when you ask for ugali you will be served cassava in the form of a thick paste with soup
Sɛ wubisa ugali wɔ Tanzania a wɔbɛma wo aduan a wɔde bankye ayɛ aduan a ɛte sɛ banku ne nkwan
In Cameroon people go for kumkum
Wɔ Cameroon no nkurɔfo ani gye kumkum ho
And in Sierra Leone especially on Saturdays cassava lovers insist on their foofoo !	Na wɔ Sierra Leone nso titiriw Memeneda wɔn a wɔn ani gye bankye ho hwehwɛ wɔn fufuo !
Whatever you call it cassava is a big part of African life
Ɛmfa ho din biara a wɔde frɛ no no bankye di dwuma titiriw wɔ Afrikafo asetra mu
So big in fact that many people feel that if they have not eaten cassava even though they have had something else they have not really eaten at all !	Nokwarem no ɛho hia araa ma nnipa pii te nka sɛ sɛ wonnii bankye a ɛnde na wonnidii ankasa ɛwom sɛ na wɔadi biribi foforo de !

How do those youths feel when they hear that Santa brings presents only to good children ?	Sɛ saa mmofra no te sɛ Papa Buronya de akyɛde brɛ mmofra pa nkutoo a wɔte nka dɛn ?
And what about youngsters in broken homes who are made painfully aware of the gap in their families at holiday time ?	Na mmofra a wɔwɔ mmusua a emu apaapae mu a wɔma wɔde yaw hu sɛ wɔn mmusua no mu atetew wɔ nnapɔnna mmere mu no nso ɛ ?
 All too often the highlight of the holiday gathering is opening the presents says The New York Times
The New York Times ka sɛ Mpɛn pii no ade titiriw a wɔyɛ wɔ nnapɔnna apontow ase ne akyɛde a wɔde mema
That emphasis gives children the message that presents are what the family gathering is all about and sets them up for disappointment
Asɛm a ɛte saa a wosi so dua ma mmofra te nka sɛ abusua apontow mu ade titiriw ne sɛ wobenya akyɛde na wɔte huammɔdi nka bere a amma saa no
Love is an even more fulfilling motivation to do good
Ɔdɔ ne ade titiriw a ɛkanyan obi kɛse ma ɔyɛ papa
Glenn Austin author of Love and Power Parent and Child states In a harmonious family where the child both loves and respects the parent the child may behave in an approved way to please the parent
Glenn Austin a ɔkyerɛw Love and Power Parent and Child no ka sɛ Wɔ abusua a biakoyɛ wom a abofra dɔ ɔwofo na obu no mu no abofra no betumi ayɛ n’ade wɔ ɔkwan a ɛfata so de asɔ ɔwofo no ani
Jehovah s Witnesses work hard to create such a warm cycle of love in their homes
Yehowa Adansefo bɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛma ɔdɔ a emu yɛ den a ɛte saa aba wɔn afie mu
Additionally the children of Jehovah s Witnesses are raised to know and love the God they serve Jehovah
Bio nso wɔtete Yehowa Adansefo mmofra ma wohu Yehowa Onyankopɔn a wɔsom no no na wɔdɔ no
What a powerful force in their lives for the doing of good !	Hwɛ tumi kɛse a eyi yɛ ma wɔyɛ papa wɔ wɔn asetram !
They need no mythical figure to extort good works
Wonhia anansesɛm mu nipa bi na wɔahyɛ wɔn ma wɔayɛ nnwuma pa
Jehovah s Witnesses cherish their children as gifts from God
Yehowa Adansefo ani gye wɔn mma ho sɛ akyɛde a efi Onyankopɔn hɔ
Hence instead of waiting for the calendar to govern gift giving these parents can give presents throughout the year
Enti sɛ anka wɔbɛtwɛn ma nna pɔtee bi a wɔahyɛ ato hɔ adu ansa na wɔakyɛ wɔn mma ade no saa awofo yi betumi akyɛ wɔn ade bere biara wɔ afe no nyinaa mu
At such times it is difficult to tell who is more thrilled the surprised youngster or his delighted parent
Wɔ mmere a ɛte saa mu no ɛyɛ den sɛ wobetumi ahu nea n’ani agye kɛse ankasa sɛ ɛyɛ abofra a ne ho adwiriw no no anaa ne wofo a n’ani agye no
The child knows where the gift came from
Abofra no nim beae a akyɛde no fi bae
Further Witness parents are encouraged to give frequently the gift of their time
Afei nso wɔhyɛ awofo Adansefo nkuran sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔtaa de wɔn bere ma wɔn mma sɛ akyɛde
For when a little girl is feeling sad or lonely how can a roomful of dolls compare with a few moments spent wrapped in her mother s arms listening to Mommy tell stories about when she was little ?	Sɛ abeawa ketewaa bi werɛ ahow anaa n’ani nka a ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na ɔdan a mmeduaba ayɛ mu ma akyekye ne werɛ asen sɛ ne maame benya bere kakra aka no afam ne ho aka ne mmofraberem ho asɛm akyerɛ no ?
Will a young boy be taught how to be a man by a closetful of baseball equipment or by long pleasant talks with his father as they go for walks together ?	So ɔdan a bɔɔl ho nneɛma ayɛ mu ma na ebetumi akyerɛkyerɛ abarimaa sɛnea wonyin bɛyɛ ɔpanyin anaa bere tenten a ɔne n’agya bɛbom atu mpasa abɔ nkɔmmɔ a ɛyɛ anigye no ?
This nurtured closeness can be lifesaving

Child researchers have found that as the proverbial generation gap opens for a youth he becomes more strongly influenced by peers
Mmofra ho nsɛm ho nhwehwɛmufo ahu sɛ sɛ mpanyin ne mmofra ammɔ a atipɛnfo nkɛntɛnso fi ase nya mmofra so tumi kɛse
Youthful misbehavior and a deteriorating attitude toward adults go hand in hand
Mmofrabɔnesɛm na ɛmma wommu mpanyimfo
But those who maintained favorable views of their fathers and adults in general didn t join with other peers in misbehaviors
Nanso wɔn a wɔkɔɔ so nyaa wɔn agyanom ne mpanyimfo nyinaa ho adwempa no amfa wɔn ho ammɔ atipɛnfo afoforo ne wɔn ammu brabɔne
Jehovah s Witnesses have at times been criticized for not sharing in holiday fun with their families
Wɔakasa atia Yehowa Adansefo sɛ wɔne wɔn mmusua mfa wɔn ho nhyɛ dapɔnna anigyede ahorow mu
It may appear that the children of Jehovah s Witnesses are deprived of this special fun
Ayɛ sɛ nea wɔde saa anigyede titiriw yi kame Yehowa Adansefo mmofra
But these sincere parents and children have sound Biblical reasons for abstaining
Nanso saa awofo no ne wɔn mma nokwaredifo yi wɔ Bible mu ntease pa ahorow a enti wɔtwe wɔn ho fi ho

And these youngsters are developing strong moral fiber that will withstand the weight of peer pressure that crushes the will of other youths
Saa mmofra nkumaa yi renya abrabɔ su a emu yɛ den a wɔde begyina atipɛnfo nhyɛso a ɛsɛe mmofra afoforo apɛde no ano
Morality is being washed away by the rising tide of wickedness

Immoral sex drugs violence alcohol cults child molesters ever so many dangers threaten vulnerable young people

How can a parent shield a youngster from these constant perils ?	Ɔwofo bɛyɛ dɛn abɔ ne ba ho ban afi saa nneɛma bɔne a ɛkɔ so daa yi ho ?
From infancy Witness children receive consistent training to lean on the strong moral laws of the Bible
Adansefo mmofra fi wɔn mmofraase nya daa ntetee a ɛbɛma wɔde wɔn ho abata Bible abrabɔ ho mmara a ɛsom bo no ho
Loving parents help them to understand God s view not only about holidays but about all aspects of life
Awofo a wɔdɔ wɔn mma boa wɔn ma wohu Onyankopɔn adwene wɔ nnapɔnna ne asetra mu nneɛma nyinaa nso ho
Obedience to their God springs from love and respect for him even if it means being different
Osetie a wɔyɛ ma wɔn Nyankopɔn no fi ɔdɔ ne obu a wɔwɔ ma no mu sɛ ɛba sɛ ɛbɛma wɔayɛ soronko mpo a
Imagine how this must prepare them for successful young adulthood !	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ eyi siesie wɔn ma wɔyɛ mmerante ne mmabaa pa !
If a young child can sit in a class full of peers who are doing what seems to be fun and take a stand for what he believes is right how much better he is able to withstand the later temptation of further seemingly fun things drugs premarital sex and other harmful enticements !

The children of Jehovah s Witnesses may develop a moral fiber that many other children may be deprived of
Yehowa Adansefo mma betumi anya abrabɔ pa su a emu yɛ den a ebia mmofra afoforo pii nni bi no
Many of the kids I ve looked at don t have faith observes Dr
Robert Coles Harvard researcher
Oduruyɛfo Robert Coles a ɔwɔ Harvard sukuupɔn mu ka sɛ Mmofra a mahwɛ wɔn no mu pii nni gyidi
They have lost everything except preoccupation with themselves and this is enhanced every day by the way they are brought up
Biribiara ho nhia wɔn gye wɔn ankasa ho a wosusuw nkutoo na ɔkwan a wɔnam so tete wɔn no ma saa su yi mu kɔ so yɛ den da biara da
A pediatrician describes a different family They want kids who care about others and who give a little of themselves
Oduruyɛfo bi ka abusua foforo bi ho asɛm sɛ Wɔpɛ mmofra a wodwen afoforo ho na wonsusuw wɔn nkutoo ho
They live a simpler life
but they have something else

Dolores Curran cites valuing service to others as basic to happiness
Dolores Curran ka nnwuma pa a wɔyɛ ma afoforo ho asɛm sɛ ɛne ade titiriw a ɛde anigye ba
For some families in our nation the United States indeed most I would say success and pursuit of the good life is the primary purpose
Wɔ yɛn man United States yi mu mmusua bi fam no nokwarem mmusua dodow no ara fam no yiyedi ne asetra pa a wɔhwehwɛ ne wɔn asetram atirimpɔw titiriw
But families who presume that members can and will be caring toward others become those healthy families who value service to others
Nanso mmusua a wosusuw sɛ emufo tumi boa afoforo no bɛyɛ mmusua pa a wobu mmoa a wɔde ma afoforo
As the children from these families grow up they tend to be quite caring and responsible persons as a result of their family experiences
Sɛ mmofra a wofi saa mmusua yi mu nyinyin a esiane ntetee a wonyae wɔ wɔn mmusua mu nti wɔbɛyɛ nnipa a wodwen afoforo ho na wogye asɛyɛde tom nso
Curran notes among successful parents a return to the value of seeking joy in people and in giving rather than in buying taking and consuming
Curran hu wɔ awofo a wɔadi nkonim wɔ abayɛn mu ho sɛ anigye a wɔkyerɛ wɔ nnipa ho ne adekyɛ som bo ma wɔn sen adetɔ adegye ne adidi
Put another way by an outstanding expert on giving there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving
Adekyɛ ho ɔdenimfo bi ka no ɔkwan foforo so sɛ ɔma mu wɔ nhyira mmom sen ogye
Witness families are living proof of this statement by Christ Jesus
Adansefo mmusua de wɔn asetra di Kristo Yesu asɛm yi ho adanse
Like him their lives are centered on the Christian ministry
Te sɛ Yesu no Kristofo som adwuma no ne wɔn asetram ade titiriw
Some may feel that Witness youths are being exploited and forced to accompany their parents from door to door
Ebia ebinom bɛte nka sɛ wɔde Adansefo mmofra yɛ adwuma na wɔhyɛ wɔn ma wɔka wɔn awofo ho kɔ afie afie asɛnka
Much to the contrary they are being taught by parental example how to show love toward their fellowman by freely giving to their neighbors good news about God s Kingdom
Matthew

Mateo
Won t It Stifle the Children ? 	 So Ɛnhyɛ Mmofra no So ? ’
But isn t a strict religious upbringing stifling to a young child ?	Nanso so nyamesom ntetee katee a wɔde ma abofra kumaa renhyɛ no so ?
Isn t it better to let religious decisions be made by each one upon reaching adulthood ?	So ɛnyɛ papa sɛ wɔbɛma ankorankoro biara anyin ayɛ ɔpanyin ansa na wasi n’ankasa gyinae wɔ nyamesom ho ?
That may be rule number of Rules for Raising Delinquent Children Never give him any spiritual training
Ɛno betumi ayɛ Rules for Raising Delinquent Children nhomawa no mu ahyɛde a ɛtɔ so abiɛsa yi Ɛmfa honhom mu ntetee biara ma no
Wait until he is and then let him decide for himself

However a child s basic moral sense according to Dr
Coles begins to bud as early as three years of age
Nanso sɛnea Oduruyɛfo Coles kyerɛ no abofra fi ase nya abrabɔ ho su bere a wadi bɛyɛ mfe abiɛsa pɛ no
Within the child there is a developing moral sense
Abofra no kɔ so nya abrabɔ su wɔ ne mu
I happen to think it is God given that there is a craving for a moral order
Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade a Onyankopɔn de ma sɛ abofra no nya abrabɔ pa ho akɔnnɔ
This is the crucial time for the inculcation of the true moral values
Saa bere yi ne bere a ɛfata a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde abrabɔ pa ho adwene dua ne mu
It is the time for instance to teach by example the value of truthfulness as opposed to lying
Sɛ nhwɛso no ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nhwɛso kyerɛkyerɛ no sɛ nokwaredi so wɔ mfaso sen atorodi
The Bible stresses the importance of training during the youthful years Train up a boy according to the way for him even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it
Proverbs
Bible no si hia a ntetee ho hia wɔ mmofraberem so dua Kyerɛ abofra ɔkwan a ɔmfa so na sɛ onyin nso a ɔremfi ho

Curran observes Children today can t be expected to be moral without help
Curran ka sɛ Wontumi nhwɛ kwan sɛ nnɛyi mmofra bebu bra pa bere a wɔmmoa wɔn
My survey respondents suggest that the healthier the family the more developed is their sense of right and wrong
Nea mihui wɔ me nhwehwɛmu no mu no kyerɛ sɛ bere dodow a abusua no yɛ papa no dodow no ara na wɔkɔ so hu nea ɛyɛ papa ne nea ɛyɛ bɔne
A social worker responding to Curran s survey observed There s an inescapable core of strength that religious faith gives families
Odwumayɛni bi a Curran bisabisaa no nsɛm wɔ ne nhwehwɛmu no mu kae sɛ Tumi kɛse a wontumi nkwati bi wɔ hɔ a nyamesom mu gyidi ma mmusua ahorow nya
For the family with a shared religious core Curran says faith in God plays a foundational role in daily family life
Wɔ abusua a emufo wɔ nyamesom mu gyidi biako mu ho no Curran ka sɛ Onyankopɔn mu gyidi di dwuma titiriw bi wɔ wɔn da biara da asetra mu
A religious core strengthens the family support system
Nyamesom mu gyidi hyɛ nhyehyɛe a abusua yɛ de boa wɔn ho wɔn ho no mu den
The parents feel a strong responsibility for passing on the faith but they do so in positive and meaningful ways

Help Your Children Feel Love for God	Boa Wo Mma ma Wonnya Onyankopɔn ho Dɔ
Show children the gifts of God that bring them such joy
Kyerɛ mmofra Onyankopɔn akyɛde horow a ɛma wonya anigye no
Lie on the grass and examine with them the tiny flower so intricately designed
Da nsesan so na ɛne wɔn nhwɛ nhwiren ketewaa a wɔayɛ no anwonwa kwan so a ɛyɛ fɛ no
Watch the ladybug that emerges from this grassy jungle to climb to the tip of a blade of grass lift its bright red and black dotted wing covers and fly away
Monhwɛ atuboa ketewa bi a ɔforo fa ahaban bi so a ɔbɔ ne ntaban kɔkɔɔ a tuntum sisi mu na ɛhyerɛn a otu kɔ no
Let them feel the breathless wonder as a butterfly suddenly lands on a hand to raise and lower its bright yellow wings for a brief rest and to soak up the warm sunshine

Roll over on your back to see the fluffy white clouds sailing overhead and watch as they change from ships to horses to palaces in the sky
Monna ayeya na monhwɛ amununkum fitaa a emu yɛ hare a ekyinkyin wim no na monhwɛ sɛnea ɛdannan yɛ biribi te sɛ po so ahyɛn apɔnkɔ ne ahemfie ahorow wɔ wim no
All the while point out to your children that it is our Creator God who brings us such joyful gifts
Ne nyinaa mu no kyerɛ wo mma no sɛ ɛyɛ Onyankopɔn a ɔyɛ yɛn Bɔfo no na ɔde akyɛde horow a ɛyɛ anigye yi ma yɛn
And many other gifts such as the kitten whose playful antics with a leaf leave us convulsed with laughter or the fuzzy puppy that attacks us head shaking from side to side growling ferociously as it tugs on our sleeve yet with friendly tail wagging nonstop all the while
Na akyɛde afoforo pii te sɛ agyinamoa ba a ɔde ahaban bi di agoru dannan ne ho ma yɛserew anaa ɔkraman ba a ne ho nhwi futurufuturu a ɔto hyɛ yɛn so huruw sɔ yɛn atade ano bere a ɔpɔ nanso ohim ne ti ne ne dua bere nyinaa de kyerɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo no
Or a frolic in the ocean surf a hike in the mountains or a night gazing up in awe at a sky packed with lights that twinkle and shine high overhead

Knowing that these gifts and countless others are from the One who gave us our life being able to thank him for these gifts feeling gratitude for knowing him all this brings joy to us and reflects a deep and appreciative love for him
Sɛ yehu sɛ saa akyɛde ahorow yi ne afoforo a wontumi nkan no fi Nea ɔmaa yɛn nkwa no hɔ na sɛ yetumi da no ase wɔ saa akyɛde ahorow yi ho na yɛkyerɛ anisɔ sɛ yɛahu no a eyinom nyinaa ma yenya anigye na ɛda ɔdɔ ne anisɔ a emu dɔ a yɛwɔ ma no adi
And finally on the family front plenty of hugs and kisses from Daddy and Mommy which help children feel the warm glow of security and thankfulness every day
Na awiei koraa no wɔ abusua no mu no sɛ Papa ne Maame sosɔ mmofra no mu fefe wɔn ano a wɔte ahobammɔ ne anisɔ nka da biara da
Help them keep faith in Jehovah rejecting an even greater lie than the one about the red suited Santa namely that all these lovely gifts from God just happened just evolved a falsehood taught without scientific evidence unsupported by the scientific method and maintained only by a dogmatism repeated over and over again and again to flood the minds of the young
Boa wɔn ma wonkura Yehowa mu gyidi mu na wɔmpow atosɛm kɛse a ɛsen nea ɛfa Papa Buronya a ɔhyɛ atade kɔkɔɔ ho a ɛne ka a wɔka sɛ saa akyɛde pa a efi Onyankopɔn hɔ yi nyinaa bae ara kwa sɛ ɛnam adannandi so atosɛm a enni nyansahu mu nnyinasosɛm biara na ntease biara nnim a wotim mpɛn pii de hyɛ mmofra adwenem no
Share with your children in frequent prayers to the greatest of Givers at meals when reading his Word at day s end
Ɛne wo mma mmom mmɔ Akyɛde Mafo kɛse no mpae bere nyinaa bere a moredidi bere a morekenkan n’Asɛm no bere a morekɔda
Raise a grateful child and that sense of appreciation will sweeten every experience he has in life
Tete abofra ma ɔnkyerɛ nneɛma ho anisɔ na saa suban pa yi bɛma n’ani agye wɔ n’asetram biribiara mu
He will grow to be a happy giver himself in imitation of the true God and of the parents he loves
Obenyin abɛyɛ obi a ɔno ankasa kyɛ ade anigye so de suasua nokware Nyankopɔn ne awofo a ɔdɔ wɔn no
Then happiness will come not with the preset days of the calendar but with the spontaneous moments of sheer joy in living
N’ani begye bere nyinaa esiane nkwa mu a ɔte nti na ɛnyɛ nna pɔtee bi a wɔahyɛ ato hɔ mu
Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah ! Psalm

 We Are Not Deprived ! 	 Yɛnhwere Hwee ! 
Comments have been made by schoolteachers and others that the children of Jehovah s Witnesses are deprived by not being allowed to join in the fun of school celebrations of Christmas Easter and Halloween

Following is a small sampling of comments of children who are Jehovah s Witnesses expressing in letters why they themselves decline to have any part in celebrating these holidays

Something that I have that is better than holidays is the wonderful organization of Jehovah s Witnesses

Me ne me nuabea de yɛn awofo aware ho afahyɛ yɛɛ yɛn ankasa abusua dapɔnna
I got the greatest joy out of planning presents and cards and things and helping my parents plan things to surprise each other than I ever did getting gifts from anyone

When I was younger some holidays were hard for me
Bere a na misua no na ɛyɛ den sɛ mɛtwe me ho afi nnapɔnna bi di ho
But later I realized that the holidays can cause greed arguments and sadness
Nanso akyiri yi mibehui sɛ nnapɔnna no tumi de anibere akyinnyegye ne awerɛhow ba
When there are set times for giving you are never surprised with a gift
Sɛ nna pɔtee bi wɔ hɔ a wɔde kyɛ ade a akyɛde nyɛ wo nwonwa bio
I would rather get special gifts at any time of the year
Anka mɛpɛ mmom sɛ menya akyɛde atitiriw wɔ afe no mu bere biara
To celebrate or not to celebrate is just a small part of a much larger decision whether or not to dedicate yourself to serve Jehovah
Sɛ wubedi nnapɔnna bi anaasɛ wunni no yɛ gyinae kɛse bi fa bi pɛ sɛ wubehyira wo ho so asom Yehowa anaasɛ wonnyɛ saa
When I think of it like that the right choice is clear

There were times when I was small that I felt I was missing out but I later laughed when I thought how eggs Jesus and the Easter bunny all got together
Bere a na misua no ɛtɔ da bi a na mete nka sɛ merehwere biribi nanso akyiri yi meserewee bere a misusuw nea ɛyɛe a wɔkaa nkesua Yesu ne Easter adanko nyinaa boom ho no
When I was older and my parents explained to me how all the symbols originated I found it disgusting
Bere a minyinii na m’awofo kyerɛkyerɛɛ me sɛnea nsɛnkyerɛnne ahorow no nyinaa fii ase no ɛyɛɛ me abofono
It hurt me to think how Jehovah and Jesus must feel to be connected with such pagan ideas

No because we have other parties and when people celebrate Christmas the kids mainly think about Santa Claus or at Easter they think about the Easter bunny but I know they are from pagan religions

The Facts Behind Christmas Easter and Halloween	Nokwasɛm a Ɛfa Buronya Easter ne Halloween Ho
THE Bible shows that Jesus was years old when he was impaled in the early spring of the year C

at the time of the Jewish Passover
BIBLE da no adi sɛ na Yesu adi mfirihyia bere a wɔbɔɔ no asɛndua mu wɔ fefɛw bere mu afe Y

This means counting backward that he was born in the early fall of the year
Eyi kyerɛ sɛ sɛ yɛkan san akyi a wɔbɛwo no ahohuru bere October afe no mfiase hɔ
Pagan Rome s celebration of Saturnalia the birthday of the invincible sun was some three months later
Na Romafo abosonsomfo no di Saturnalia owia a wontumi nhu no no awoda bɛyɛ asram abiɛsa akyi
How did the celebration of Jesus birth get pushed forward to December to make it coincide blasphemously with the pagan celebration of the birthday of the sun ?	Ɛyɛɛ dɛn na wopiaa Yesu awodadi kɔɔ anim koduu December ma ɛne abosonsomfo abusude a ɛne owia no awodadi kohyiae ?
The ever shorter days of December stirred up superstitious panic among the sun worshipers who feared that their god was dying
Esum a ɛba ntɛm anwummere ne anim a ɛntetew ntɛm adekyee wɔ December mu no kanyan ehu a egyina gyidihunu so wɔ owia asomfo mu sɛ gyama wɔn nyame no rewu
They burned candles and lit bonfires to help revive the ailing deity

Following the winter solstice of December the sun god appeared to regain his strength as the days grew longer

December was the major month of pagan celebration and Dec
was the high point of the winter revelries explains Church Christmas Tab
Church Christmas Tab nhoma no kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Na December ne ɔsram titiriw a abosonsomfo di wɔn afahyɛ na na Dec

as the birth date of Christ in order to sanctify the pagan celebrations
Ebinom gye di sɛ Roma sɔfopɔn no paw Dec
sɛ Kristo awoda sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ na ɔde bɛtew ’ abosonsomfo afahyɛ ahorow no ho
What resulted was a strange mixture of the pagan and the Christian festivals that the world now calls Christmas
Nea efii mu bae ne abosonsomfo ne Kristofo afahyɛ ahorow a adi afra wɔ ɔkwan a ntease nnim so a wiase no frɛ no Buronya nnɛ no
The article admits The word Christmas does not appear in the Bible

And Scripture gives no mandate for celebrating Jesus birth
Na biribiara nni Kyerɛwnsɛm no mu a ɛkyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yedi Yesu awoda
No wonder theologian Tertullian complained By us who are strangers to Sabbaths and new moons and festivals once acceptable to God the Saturnalia and other pagan feasts are now frequented gifts are carried to and fro
and sports and banquets are celebrated with uproar

The Rites of Spring	Fefɛw Bere mu Amanne Ahorow
Easter was originally the spring festival in honor of the Teutonic goddess of light and spring known in Anglo Saxon as Eastre

The Easter bonnet originally was a wreath of flowers or leaves
Mfiase no na Easter kyɛw no yɛ nhwiren anaa nhaban a wɔanwene
The circle or crown expressed the round sun and its course in the heavens which brought the return of spring

The new Easter outfit developed because it was considered discourteous and therefore bad luck to greet the Scandinavian goddess of Spring or Eastre in anything but fresh garb since the goddess was bestowing one on the earth

 MY PROBLEM says Claudia is that my mom gets nervous and irritable
CLAUDIA ka sɛ Nea ɛhaw me ne sɛ me maame fa abufuw na asɛm yɛ no ahi ntɛmntɛm dodo
One day she asked how my piano lesson had gone
Obisaa me da bi sɛ adakabɛn a meresua bɔ no te dɛn
I simply said that it had gone all right and went in to practice the piano
Me maa no mmuae tiawa sɛ eye na mekɔɔ adakabɛn no ho sɛ merekɔ toa ne sua no so
Mom came in angrily said that I was being rude then stormed off

I got upset and banged on the piano and ran to my room

Mom then came and scolded me for banging on the piano

Parents may be really touchy when they are in a bad mood
Awofo betumi ayɛ nnipa a nsɛm haw wɔn ntɛmntɛm ankasa wɔ mmere a wonni anigye mu
At times you may feel that you must walk on eggs around them nervously awaiting the next time you will get criticized yelled at or even blamed

showed however that it s perfectly normal for parents to get moody from time to time

Stress fatigue poor health and the pressures of life are often to blame

Knowing this may help you to sympathize with your folks

Warning Signals	Nea Ɛkyerɛ sɛ Nsɛm Haw Wɔn
Proverbs says By wisdom a household will be built up and by discernment it will prove firmly established
Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Wɔde nyansa na esi dan na wɔde nhumu ma egyina
In harmony with this principle one thing you can do is try to discern when your parents are in a bad mood
Nea ɛne saa nnyinasosɛm yi hyia no ade biako a wubetumi ayɛ ne sɛ wobɛbɔ mmɔden ahu bere a w’awofo nni anigye no
The psalmist said of his own depressed state All day long I have walked about sad
Odwontofo no kaa n’ankasa ne haw a na wahaw no ho asɛm sɛ Da mu nyinaa mede awerɛhow menam foofoo
An observant person would surely have detected that something was wrong with him !	Nokwarem no na obi a ɔhwɛ ade yiye a betumi ahu sɛ biribi haw no !
In a similar way a parent will usually give clear cut signs that he or she is not in the best of moods
Ɔkwan a ɛte saa so no nsɛnkyerɛnne bi bɛda adi pefee wɔ ɔwofo bi ho sɛ onni anigye mu
The youthful authors of the book The Kids Book About Parents thus compiled a list of common warning signals for young people to watch out for
Enti mmofra a wɔkyerɛw nhoma The Kids ’ Book About Parents no ahyehyɛ kɔkɔbɔ nsɛnkyerɛnne ahorow bi a ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra hu
Among the things noted were parents eating a lot not talking going to bed early not saying hi when they come home from work snapping at everyone ignoring your questions and staring blankly at the TV
Nea ɛka ho bi ne bere a awofo didi pii wɔyɛ komm wɔda ntɛm wofi adwuma ba fie a wɔnkyia wɔkasatia obiara abufuw so wubisa wɔn nsɛm a wommua ’ ne TV a wɔhwɛ no haa ’
In other families parents are predictably touchy at certain times such as when bills have to be paid
Wɔ mmusua afoforo mu no awofo bo taa fuw wɔ mmere pɔtee bi mu te sɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wotua aka
Whatever the case by being observant you may be able to recognize your own parents warning signals

Proverbs says A wise son is the one that makes a father rejoice

This does not mean that you must burden yourself with your parents grown up problems

After all each parent must carry his own load
Efisɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔwofo biara soa n’ankasa n’adesoa
But you can at least show an interest in them
Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no wubetumi akyerɛ wɔn ho anigye
For example you might tactfully ask Is something wrong ? 	Sɛ nhwɛso no wubetumi abisa wɔn anifere so sɛ So biribi atoto ? ’

Then I gave her a big kiss and said I love you Mom

Vedral A perfect remedy for a grouchy parent is affection

The Bible tells us of how David as a youth coped with a similarly touchy situation
Bible no ka sɛnea Dawid sɛ abofra no gyinaa tebea a ɛhaw adwene saa ara ano
As a youth David worked in the court of King Saul as a musician
Sɛ abofra no na Dawid yɛ adwuma wɔ Ɔhene Saul ahemfi sɛ odwontofo
Saul however was subject to unpredictable mood swings and fits of rage
Nanso na Saul koko haw no enti na ne bo tumi fuw bere biara
Why on one occasion Saul tried to pin David to the wall with a spear !	Da bi mpo ɔbɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔde peaw bɛwɔw Dawid afam ban ho !
Notice though what the Bible says at Samuel of David s behavior And David was continually acting prudently in all his ways and Jehovah was with him
Nanso hyɛ nea Bible no ka wɔ Dawid nneyɛe ho wɔ Samuel New World Translation no nsow Na Dawid kɔɔ so yɛɛ ade nyansam na Yehowa dii n’akyi
Few parents are as volatile as King Saul

Still you may need to be prudent when dealing with them

Ɛsɛ sɛ wohwɛ wo kasa ne wo nneyɛe yiye ankasa
You have to try not to upset him
Ɛsɛ sɛ wobɔ mmɔden sɛ worenhyɛ no abufuw
The Bible puts it this way Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself
Proverbs

This does not necessarily mean giving your parents a wide berth

Try to be as warm and sociable as you can
Bɔ mmɔden da ɔdɔ ne adamfofa su adi sɛnea wubetumi kyerɛ wɔn
If you pester a grouchy parent with needless questions or with petty problems that could be discussed at another time you may be asking for trouble

You are therefore wise to avoid any irritating habits that you know get on your parents nerves such as snapping chewing gum or cracking your knuckles
Enti nyansa wom sɛ wobɛkwati su biara a ɛhaw adwene a wunim sɛ ɛhyɛ w’awofo abufuw te sɛ kyingam a wɔyɛ no tetateta anaa nsateaa a wototom
Along the same lines it would be inconsiderate of you to blast your stereo or play the television at full volume
Saa nso na ɛnkyerɛ ayamye sɛ wobɛbɔ nnwom ma ayɛ dede anaa wubebue wo television ma akasa kɛse dodo
Another way to act prudently is to take the initiative
Ɔkwan foforo a wobɛfa so ayɛ ade nyansam nso ne sɛ wubedi kan ayɛ biribi
Is Mom always in a bad mood when she comes home from work ?	Sɛ Mama fi adwuma ba fie bere nyinaa a ne bo fuw ?
If you come home first why not set the table take out the garbage or do the dishes ?	Sɛ wudi kan ba fie a dɛn nti na wonnoa aduan nkɔto wura ngu anaa wonhohoro nkankyee no mu ?
Greet your mother affectionately

Such gestures might make her look forward to homecoming

She says My mom drives a school bus and she usually comes home upset
Ɔka sɛ Me maame ka bɔs a ɛfa mmofra kɔ sukuu na mpɛn pii no ɔbɛba fie na ne bo afuw
So I have to lie low

I just stay out of her way until she s calmed down
Menkasa ne ho araa kosi sɛ ne bo bedwo
Then I ll watch the kids for her or clean or do something for her
Afei mehwɛ mmofra nkumaa no anaa meyɛ biribi foforo ma no
Try as you may to avoid it some conflict is almost sure to ensue when parents are touchy or irritable

When this occurs application of Bible principles can help you avoid making a bad situation worse
Sɛ ɛba saa a Bible nnyinasosɛm ahorow a wode bedi dwuma betumi aboa wo ma woakwati sɛ wobɛma tebea no asɛe koraa
Proverbs for example says An answer when mild turns away rage but a word causing pain makes anger to come up
Sɛ nhwɛso no Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Mmuae bɔkɔɔ sianka anibere na asɛnnennen hwanyan abufuw mu
Further guidance is given at Proverbs which reads Anyone holding back his sayings is possessed of knowledge and a man of discernment is cool of spirit
Akwankyerɛ foforo a wɔde ama nso ne nea ɛwɔ Mmebusɛm a ɛkenkan sɛ Nea ɔkyɛe ne nsɛm hu nimdeɛ na nea ne honhom dwo yɛ nhumu nipa

Wɔde me kɔɔ Yatala beae a wɔde nneduafo a wɔde wɔn agu afiase afebɔɔ wɔ awudi ho kogu no
But again I had many opportunities to talk to others about the hope of God s Kingdom and the permanent peace it will bring to this war torn world

Before appearing in court on each occasion I was taken to an army barracks

The first time there I was ridiculed and abused by a Lieutenant Laphorn because of my refusal to take the oath of military allegiance

But when I appeared before him the third time he said You know I thought you were a coward

But I have watched the way you take your medicine

You gave up a good career and have proved your faith by coming back for more
Wugyaee adwuma pa na wonam w’aso a woma wɔkɔ so twe no so ada wo gyidi adi
When I was to be sentenced to prison for the third time petitions were filed for me to be tried as a conscientious objector
Bere a na wɔde me rebɛto afiase ne mprɛnsa so no wɔsrɛ maa me sɛ wonni m’asɛm sɛ obi a n’ahonim nti wapow akodi
The magistrate was forced to grant my petition since I had resigned from the police force in over a matter of conscience

However showing his bias he said I want it to go on record that I believe it is dangerous to have such a fanatic as you loose in the community

Early Background	Me Kan Asetra
I was born in in Gawler not far from Adelaide South Australia
Wɔwoo me wɔ Gawler a ɛbɛn Adelaide South Australia
When I was about six Sarah Marchant a dear friend of my mother taught me that hell is man s common grave and not a place of fiery torment
Bere a midii mfe asia no Sarah Marchant a na ɔyɛ me maame yɔnko berɛbo kyerɛɛ me sɛ hell yɛ adesamma adamoa na ɛnyɛ baabi a wɔde ogya yɛ ayayade
She was an International Bible Student as Jehovah s Witnesses were then known
Na ɔyɛ Amanaman Ntam Bible Osuani sɛnea na wɔfrɛ Yehowa Adansefo saa bere no
In time as I grew up I asked our Baptist minister how Jesus Christ differs from God and he could not give me a satisfactory answer
Bere a minyinii no mibisaa yɛn Baptist sɔfo no nsonsonoe a ɛwɔ Yesu Kristo ne Onyankopɔn mu na wantumi amma me mmuae a ɛfata
So I lost interest in the churches though I enjoyed listening to Sarah Marchant when we met occasionally
Enti m’ani annye asɔre ahorow no ho bio ɛwom sɛ sɛ mihyia Sarah Marchant a na m’ani gye sɛ metie no de
In I began working in Adelaide as a clerk for the South Australian police commissioner Brigadier General Sir Raymond Leane
Mifii ase yɛɛ adwuma wɔ Adelaide sɛ ɔkrakyeni wɔ South Australia polisi panyin Ɔsahene Raymond Leane office wɔ mu
Then in Mr

Learning Bible Truths	Bible Nokware Ahorow a Misuae
Three years after getting married in while on vacation with my in laws in Gawler I picked up the book entitled Creation published in by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
Mewaree wɔ akyi mfe abiɛsa bere a na makɔ me nsenom nkyɛn wɔ Gawler rekogye m’ahome no mekenkan nhoma a wɔato din Creation a Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no tintimii wɔ mu no
It had been left with my in laws by Sarah Marchant
Ɛyɛ Sarah Marchant na ɔde gyaa me nsenom
The book explained that man is a soul and does not possess a separate invisible soul
Nhoma no kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ onipa yɛ ɔkra na onni ɔkra soronko bi a wontumi nhu no
This made sense
Na ntease wɔ eyi mu
But I wanted to see it for myself in the Bible
Nanso m’ankasa mepɛe sɛ mihu wɔ Bible no mu
So I searched out the family King James Version and read Genesis And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
Enti mekɔfaa abusua no King James Version Bible no na mekenkan Genesis sɛ Na AWURADE Nyankopɔn de fam dɔte nwenee onipa na ohuw nkwa home guu ne hwene mu na onipa yɛɛ ɔkra teasefo
This stirred me deeply so I read on and on
Eyi kanyan me yiye enti mekɔɔ so kenkanee
I could not put the book Creation down
Na mintumi nnyae Creation nhoma no kenkan
This is surely the truth I said to myself
Mekaa no me tirim sɛ Eyi ne nokware no
’
Now I wanted more Watch Tower Society books to read
Afei na mepɛ Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no nhoma pii akenkan
The only other one the family had was entitled Life
Foforo biako pɛ a na abusua no wɔ ara ne nea wɔato din Life no
So I read that one right through too
Enti mekanee saa nhoma no nso nyinaa
A few days later we returned to Adelaide and moved into another house
Nna kakraa bi akyi no yɛsan kɔɔ Adelaide na yetu kɔtraa ofie foforo mu
That very day we received a surprise visit from Sarah Marchant
Saa da no ara Sarah Marchant bɛsraa yɛn mpofirim
My mother in law had told her of my interest and she called to see how we were settling into our new home and to assess what spiritual help I needed
Na m’ase bea aka m’anigye no ho asɛm akyerɛ no na na ɔrebɛhwɛ sɛnea nneɛma rekɔ so wɔ yɛn fie foforo no mu na wahu honhom mu mmoa a mehia
The next morning our new next door neighbor called to me over the fence I believe you are interested in the writings of Judge Rutherford then president of the Watch Tower Society
Ade kyee anɔpa no yɛn fipamfo a ɔtoa yɛn so no frɛɛ me wɔ ban no akyi kae sɛ Migye di sɛ w’ani gye Judge Rutherford a saa bere no na ɔyɛ Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no titrani nhoma horow ho
How do you know that ? I asked
Mibisae sɛ Woyɛɛ dɛn hui ? 
 Oh a little bird told me he answered
Obuae sɛ Oh obi na ɔka kyerɛɛ me
Obviously Sarah had informed him
Ɛda adi pefee sɛ Sarah na na aka akyerɛ no
That man James Irvine was the only Witness at that time living in the northern suburbs of Adelaide
Na saa ɔbarima no James Irvine nkutoo ne Ɔdansefo a na ɔte Adelaide atifi fam borɔn no so saa bere no
He was a pioneer or full time minister of Jehovah s Witnesses and he began a regular home Bible study with me

Progress in Bible Truth	Nkɔso a Minyae wɔ Bible mu Nokware no Mu
When I returned to work in the police department I was fired up with the good things I had learned
Bere a mesan kɔtoaa polisi adwuma no so no nneɛma pa a na masua no ho anigye kaa me
So whenever I had opportunity I began to tell my workmates about my newfound faith
Enti bere biara a minya hokwan no na mifi ase ka me gyidi foforo no ho asɛm kyerɛ me mfɛfo adwumayɛfo no
However I was disappointed when my enthusiasm met with ridicule
Nanso m’abam bui bere a wodii m’anigyesɛm no ho fɛw no
Quite unexpectedly my own wife began to oppose my taking such an interest in the Bible
Bere a na menhwɛ kwan no m’ankasa me yere fii ase sɔre tiaa me sɛ makyerɛ anigye a ɛte saa wɔ Bible no ho
But with Jehovah s help I was able to weather her opposition
Nanso ɛdenam Yehowa mmoa so no mitumi dwudwoo ne sɔretia no ano
In I dedicated my life to Jehovah and was baptized
Mihyiraa me nkwa so maa Yehowa ma wɔbɔɔ me asu wɔ mu
In those days there was only one congregation in Adelaide and only about attended the weekly Bible study using The Watchtower
Saa bere no na asafo biako pɛ na ɛwɔ Adelaide na bɛyɛ nnipa pɛ na na wɔba dapɛn dapɛn Bible adesua a na wɔde Ɔwɛn Aban yɛ no ase
One day Harold Jones the presiding overseer of the congregation told me We have a job for you
Da bi Harold Jones asafo no guamtrani no ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ Yɛpɛ sɛ yɛma wo adwuma bi
We need someone to look after our territory records
Yehia obi a ɔbɛhwɛ yɛn asasesin ho kyerɛwtohɔ so
The job was perfect for me since in my police work I would drive all over Adelaide
Na adwuma no fata me efisɛ bere a na mewɔ polisi adwumam no na mede kar kyinkyin fa Adelaide kurow mu no nyinaa mu
I knew the city thoroughly and was thus able to prepare well the territory maps we used in our preaching
Na minim kurow no mu yiye ma enti mitumi siesiee asasesin no ho nkratasin a yɛde dii dwuma wɔ asɛnka adwuma mu no yiye
In April Joseph Rutherford the Watch Tower Society s president visited Australia and gave a talk in Sydney that was attended by over even though there were then only Witnesses in all Australia
Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no titrani Joseph Rutherford baa Australia nsrahwɛ wɔ April mu na ɔmaa ɔkasa wɔ Sydney maa atiefo a wɔn dodow boro tiei ɛwom mpo sɛ na Adansefo a wɔwɔ Australia nyinaa dodow si pɛ de
In Adelaide about of us were unable to make the mile km journey to Sydney
Yɛn a na yɛwɔ Adelaide no mu bɛyɛ antumi antu kilomita kwan no ankɔ Sydney
So we rented the old Tivoli Theater and had a landline hookup installed to carry Rutherford s talk from Sydney
Enti yɛkɔfɛm Tivoli Agoruhwɛbea dedaw no na yɛma wɔyɛɛ telefon ho nhyehyɛe nam so tiee ɔkasa no fii Sydney
We arranged radio advertising and as a result about came to hear the talk in Adelaide !	Yɛbɔɔ ɔkasa no ho dawuru wɔ radio so na ɛnam saa nti nnipa bɛyɛ betiee ɔkasa no wɔ Adelaide !
How I Lost My Police Job	Nea Ɛyɛe a Mehweree M’adwuma
In World War II began and the neutrality of Jehovah s Witnesses came under close scrutiny by various authorities
Wiase Ko II fii ase wɔ mu na atumfo ahorow nyinaa ani baa afa biara a Yehowa Adansefo nni no ho yiye
On one occasion two reporters from the newspaper Truth came to the Kingdom Hall and in a hostile manner tried to push their way in
Da bi atesɛm krataa Truth akyerɛwfo baanu baa Ahenni Asa so na wɔnam ahantan so bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkɔ asa no so
I simply prevented them from doing so since they seemed to be up to no good
Esiane sɛ na wɔpɛ sɛ wɔhaw adwene nti misiw wɔn kwan
The next morning a headline in the paper read S outh A ustralian Policeman Doorkeeper at J

Kingdom Hall
Ɛda a edi hɔ no asɛm bi puei wɔ atesɛm krataa no mu a na n’asɛmti kan sɛ S outh A ustralia Polisini Ɔpon Ano Hwɛfo wɔ Yehowa Adansefo Ahenni Asa So
As a result of that incident I was ostracized by my workmates
Ɛnam saa asɛm no nti me mfɛfo adwumayɛfo pow me
My immediate superior a staunch Catholic activist fed the police commissioner Raymond Leane false information about me
Me panyin a mehyɛ n’ase Katolekni amapa bi kekaa me ho atosɛm kyerɛɛ polisi panyin Raymond Leane
Then suddenly in August I was brought before Mr
Leane the same man for whom I had started working years earlier
Afei awerɛfim wɔ August mu no wɔde me kɔɔ Owura Leane anim onipa koro no ara a na me ne no yɛ adwuma bere a mifii adwuma ase mfe a na atwam no
The charge ?	Sobo bɛn na wɔbɔɔ me ?
That I would not obey all his orders
Sɛ mempɛ sɛ medi n’ahyɛde nyinaa so
Would you shoot someone if I ordered you to do so ? he asked
Obisae sɛ Sɛ mehyɛ wo sɛ to obi tuo a wobɛto ? 
 That is a hypothetical situation I replied
Mibuae sɛ Eyi yɛ nsusuwii de
But no I certainly would not shoot anybody
Nanso dabi merento obiara tuo da
For two hours he tried to show me how foolish I was to belong to an organization that was on the official blacklist and that was about to be banned in Australia
Ɔde nnɔnhwerew abien bɔɔ mmɔden kyerɛɛ me kwasea a mayɛ sɛ mede me ho akɔhyɛ ahyehyɛde a wɔabɔ no ato hɔ a ɛnkyɛ wɔrebɛbra wɔ Australia no mu
He concluded And after all I ve done for you giving you such a good career
Ɔde baa awiei sɛ Nea mayɛ ama wo yi adwuma pa a ɛte sɛɛ a mede ama wo nyinaa akyi
That I appreciate I responded
Mibuae sɛ M’ani sɔ
And I have tried to show my appreciation by hard work
Na mabɔ mmɔden ayɛ adwumaden de ada m’anisɔ no adi
But I cannot put you above my worship of Jehovah God
Nanso mintumi mmu wo nsen ɔsom a mede ma Yehowa Nyankopɔn no
You had better either leave Jehovah s Witnesses or resign the commissioner responded
Ɔpanyin no kae sɛ Ɛsɛ sɛ wopaw sɛ wubegyae Yehowa Adansefo som no anaasɛ wubegyae adwuma no
So I resigned immediately
Enti migyaee adwuma no amonom hɔ ara
In August a headline in the newspaper Truth read Rutherford Policeman Resigns

Serving Under Ban	Bere a Wɔabara Yɛn
I enjoyed working at my new trade until January when a nationwide ban was placed on Jehovah s Witnesses
Meyɛɛ m’adwuma foforo yi araa kosii January bere a wɔbaraa Yehowa Adansefo wɔ ɔman no nyinaa mu no
All printing of our literature in the country ceased at least as far as the authorities knew
Sɛnea na atumfo no susuw no yegyaee yɛn nhoma ahorow a na yetintim wɔ ɔman no mu no nyinaa
Actually underground printeries were set up all in the Sydney area and we never missed receiving an issue of The Watchtower during the ban !	Nokwarem no yɛyɛɛ sum ase nhoma tintim ho nhyehyɛe a na ne nyinaa wɔ Sydney mpɔtam hɔ na yɛanhwere Ɔwɛn Aban no bi da wɔ bere a wɔbaraa yɛn no mu !
Shortly after our work was banned I served the two jail terms described at the outset
Bere a wɔbaraa yɛn adwuma no akyi bere tiaa bi na wɔde me too afiase mprenu a mekaa ho asɛm mfiase no
Finally in June the High Court of Australia ruled that the ban was in violation of the Constitution so the government returned all the property that had been seized from the Watch Tower Society
Awiei koraa no wɔ June mu no Australia Asennibea Kunini hyɛe sɛ bara a wɔabara yɛn no tia ɔman no amanyɔ mmara enti aban no san de Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo agyapade a na wɔagye nyinaa maa Asafo no
In retrospect it is hard to believe that during those years homes including mine were raided by police officers
Sɛ mitwa m’ani hwɛ m’akyi a ɛyɛ den sɛ megye adi sɛ saa mfe no mu no polisifo baa afie afie a na me de ka ho bɛhwehwɛɛ hɔ faa nneɛma
Yet despite the opposition we continued our house to house preaching with the use of our Bibles only
Nanso ɛmfa ho ɔsɔretia a ɛbae no yɛkɔɔ so yɛɛ yɛn afie afie asɛnka adwuma no a na yɛde Bible nkutoo na edi dwuma
Many times the police followed us
Mpɛn pii no na polisifo no tetɛw yɛn
Plainclothes policemen even attended our meetings held in private homes
Polisifo a na wɔnhyɛ polisi ntade baa yɛn adesua horow a na yɛyɛ wɔ nkurɔfo afie mu no ase
Once when introducing a representative from the Sydney branch office I noted Among us are two members of the South Australian police force

Please welcome them ! 	Yɛsrɛ mo monnye wɔn anigye so ! 
They were surprised and embarrassed but stayed and enjoyed the meeting saying afterward that they could only file a favorable report

Religious Intolerance	Nyamesom ho Koma a Wonni
In April we organized a convention at the town hall in a suburb of Adelaide
Yɛyɛɛ ɔmantam nhyiam bi ho nhyehyɛe wɔ April mu wɔ Adelaide kurotia asa bi a amanfo bɔ gua hɔ so
On Sunday April the widely advertised public talk The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth was scheduled
Yɛde baguam ɔkasa a na yɛabɔ ho dawuru kɛse a na n’asɛmti ne Ahobrɛasefo Benya Asase no Adi no hyɛɛ Kwasida April
But trouble began to brew early in the morning
Nanso basabasayɛ bi sɔree anɔpa no
As convention overseer I went to the local police station to warn of impending trouble
Sɛ nhyiam no sohwɛfo no mekɔɔ ɛhɔ polisi adwumam de ɔhaw a na ɛreba no ho amanneɛ kɔbɔɔ wɔn
However my visit and complaint were all but ignored
Nanso obiara anni m’amanneɛbɔ no ho dwuma
As time came for the public talk to begin a mob formed
Bere dui sɛ wɔbɛma baguam ɔkasa no basabasayɛfo bi boaboaa wɔn ho ano
Some moved inside as soon as the talk began
Bere a ɔkasa no fii ase pɛ na ebinom baa ɔdan no mu
Several burly members of the mob surged forward trying to wreck the sound equipment
Basabasayɛfo no mu pii bɔɔ twi baa anim na wɔbɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛsɛe akasam afiri no
Then stones began to come through the windows
Afei wofii ase totoo abo faa mfɛnsere no mu
Radio stations were informed of the trouble and they quickly broadcast that a riot was in progress
Wɔde ɔhaw yi ho amanneɛ kɔbɔɔ radio nnwuma ahorow na wɔbɔɔ ho amanneɛ ntɛm so sɛ basabasayɛ bi rekɔ so
Thousands of curiosity seekers gathered outside

Sadly we were forced to discontinue the meeting
Awerɛhosɛm ne sɛ wɔhyɛɛ yɛn maa yegyaee nhyiam no yɛ
But when it came time to leave the hall the police opened up a path for us and the whole crowd became silent
Nanso bere a ɛbae sɛ yɛrefi asa no so no polisifo no bɔɔ ɔkwan maa yɛn na nnipadɔm no nyinaa yɛɛ komm
All could see the foolishness of those opposing us because out came ordinary people including elderly men and women as well as young children

Yet for years afterward Jehovah s Witnesses were not permitted to use town hall facilities in South Australia
Nanso wɔamma Yehowa Adansefo kwan ma wɔamfa South Australia adan a amanfo bɔ gua wom no anyɛ nhyiam wɔ mfe pii mu
Once in the mid s I talked to the caretaker of the Norwood town hall in a suburb of Adelaide about the use of their hall for our district convention
Bere bi mfinimfini hɔ me ne nea na ɔhwɛ Adelaide borɔn Norwood asa a wɔbɔ gua wom so no kaa wɔn asa no a na yɛpɛ sɛ yɛde yɛ yɛn ɔmantam nhyiam ho asɛm
You are banned for life from using town halls he said
Ɔkae sɛ Wɔabara mo afebɔɔ sɛ monnyɛ nhyiam wɔ kurow no asa ahorow so
You are behind the times I replied

Then I pulled from my bag the brochure about the New York Yankee Stadium international convention
Afei miyii nhomawa a ɛka New York Yankee Agumadibea so amanaman ntam nhyiam ho asɛm no fii bag mu kyerɛɛ no
Look what is going on with Jehovah s Witnesses in other places over at one meeting ! I noted
Mekae sɛ Hwɛ nea Yehowa Adansefo reyɛ wɔ mmeae afoforo sɛ nnipadɔm bɛboro ahyiam wɔ nhyiam biako ase ! 
He took the brochure carefully studied it and after a while said Yes it does look like things have changed
Ogyee nhomawa no hwɛɛ mu yiye na bere tiaa bi akyi no ɔkae sɛ Yiw ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nneɛma asesa
From then on the use of such facilities opened up for us throughout South Australia

In after a long illness my wife died
Me yere wui bere a na wayare bere tenteenten
Before her death however she began to reflect a love for Bible truth and for Jehovah God
Nanso ansa na ɔrewu no n’ani fii ase gyee Bible mu nokware ho na onyaa Yehowa Nyankopɔn ho dɔ
This was due largely to the kindness shown her by loving Witnesses over the years
Nea ɛde eyi bae titiriw ne ayamye a Adansefo a wɔwɔ ɔdɔ yii no adi kyerɛɛ no wɔ mfe pii mu no
Then in December I married Thea who has served Jehovah for many years
Afei mewaree Thea a na ɔde mfe pii asom Yehowa no wɔ December mu
For about years now I have been serving Jehovah contentedly
Mede akomatɔyam asom Yehowa bɛyɛ mfe ni
Because of always trusting in Jehovah sticking close to his organization and never compromising under pressure I can look back on a life of many privileges and blessings
Esiane sɛ mede me ho to Yehowa so bere nyinaa na minnyaee me gyidi mu wɔ ɔhyɛ ase nti sɛ mibu kɔmpɔ hwɛ m’akyi wɔ m’asetra mu a manya hokwan ne nhyira ahorow pii

The Witnesses refusal to accept blood transfusions led to many confrontations with some in the medical profession
Pow a Adansefo no pow sɛ wobegye mogya no de ntawntawdi baa wɔne nnuruyɛfo binom ntam
Hospital Liaison Committees	Ayaresabea Ntam Nkitahodi Boayikuw Ahorow
To support the Witnesses in their refusal to receive blood to clear away misunderstandings on the part of doctors and hospitals and to create a more cooperative spirit between medical institutions and Witness patients Hospital Liaison Committees were established by the Governing Body of Jehovah s Witnesses
Nea ɛbɛyɛ na aboa Adansefo no wɔ mogya a wonnye ho ayi ntease a nnuruyɛfo ne ayaresabea ahorow bi nni afi hɔ na biakoyɛ abɛda nnuruyɛfo ne Adansefo a wɔyare ntam no Yehowa Adansefo Sodikuw no hyehyɛɛ Ayaresabea Ntam Nkitahodi Boayikuw ahorow
Made up of mature Witnesses trained to deal understandingly with doctors and hospitals these committees defused confrontations and they established a more cooperative spirit
Emufo yɛ Adansefo a wɔn ho akokwaw a wɔatete wɔn ma wɔatumi ne nnuruyɛfo ne ayaresabea ahorow adi nsɛm wɔ ɔkwan a ntease wom so saa boayikuw ahorow yi adwudwo akasakasa ahorow ano na ɛde biakoyɛ honhom aba
From a handful of such committees in their number has now grown to in lands
Efi boayikuw kakraa bi a na ɛwɔ hɔ so no akuw no dodow akɔ anim abedu wɔ nsase so mprempren
That means that their helpful services are now available to some
million of Jehovah s Witnesses
Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ Yehowa Adansefo mu ɔpepem
nsa tumi ka wɔn mmoa mprempren
More than elders in congregations of Jehovah s Witnesses have been trained to speak with doctors to help them see from medical literature itself all the things that can be done without resorting to blood transfusions
Wɔatete Yehowa Adansefo asafo ahorow mu mpanyimfo bɛboro ma wɔne nnuruyɛfo akasa na aboa wɔn ma wɔatumi ahu nnuru ahorow a wobetumi de adi dwuma a mogya nnim nyinaa afi nnuruyɛ ho nhoma ahorow mu
In cases where there is some special need appropriate articles are faxed directly to the hospital to help physicians treat Witnesses without using blood
Bere a biribi titiriw bi ho abehia no wɔnam fax so de nsɛm ahorow a ɛho hia kɔma ayaresabea no tee na aboa nnuruyɛfo no ma wɔayɛ Adansefo no nnuru a mogya nnim
Or the committees arrange for consultation with other cooperative doctors to develop strategies for bloodless treatment or surgery
Anaasɛ boayikuw no yɛ nhyehyɛe ma wɔne nnuruyɛfo afoforo a wɔte wɔn asɛm ase susuw akwan horow a wɔbɛfa so asa yare anaa wɔayɛ oprehyɛn a wɔmfa mogya nni dwuma
For example in multitudes of cases of blood loss resulting in severe anemia in which doctors said there was need for a transfusion to elevate the red cell count Hospital Liaison Committee members have been able to share articles from medical literature showing the efficacy of recombinant erythropoietin EPO to do the same thing

Some doctors have felt that EPO would not work fast enough to make up the need but a number of cases involving Jehovah s Witnesses have illustrated how quickly it gets results
Nnuruyɛfo binom ate nka sɛ EPO ntumi nni ahiade ho dwuma ntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ nanso nsɛm pii a ɛfa Yehowa Adansefo ho ama sɛnea etumi di dwuma ntɛm no ada adi
In one instance on the very day after EPO was administered the count of new red cells was already four times normal !	Bere a wɔde EPO maa obi no wohui da no ara sɛ nkwammoaa kɔkɔɔ a wonnyinyinii no abu abɔ ho mpɛn anan asen nea wɔtaa nya no !
In another day the patient stabilized and by the fourth day the red cell count was starting to rise
Da a edi hɔ no ɔyarefo no ani so daa hɔ na eduu ɛda a ɛto so anan no na nkwammoaa kɔkɔɔ a wɔanyinyin no afi ase redɔɔso
In a few more days it was rising swiftly
Nna kakraa bi akyi no na ɛredɔɔso ntɛmntɛm
The patient survived
Ɔyarefo no ho tɔɔ no
In this way the doctors as well as the patient were benefited by the activities of these Hospital Liaison Committees

When doctors in Australia said they were unable to save the life of a Witness patient without using blood for treating a rare tropical disease they appealed to the local Hospital Liaison Committee for any help the committee could give them in locating information on nonblood medical management

The Australia branch office of Jehovah s Witnesses was notified of the need

Also indicating the extent to which Jehovah s Witnesses have gone to assist those in need when they face a faith challenging medical situation has been the arrangement for transferring a patient from one hospital to another from one part of a country to another and even from one country to another

More Doctors Cooperating	Nnuruyɛfo Pii Reboa
Improvement in the situation for Jehovah s Witnesses can also be seen in the growing number of physicians willing to cooperate with them in this matter from about five years ago to more than now in lands
Wotumi hu nkɔso a aba wɔ tebea yi ho ama Yehowa Adansefo no nso wɔ nnuruyɛfo dodow a wɔredɔɔso a wɔne wɔn reyɛ adwene wɔ asɛm yi ho a wɔn dodow fi wɔ mfe anum a atwam no mu abedu bɛboro mprempren wɔ nsase so no mu
That number of capable doctors has made possible another favorable development the forming of more than bloodless medical and surgery centers in various lands

Thus nowadays at least in North America one hardly hears of efforts to force a blood transfusion on an adult and many other lands are developing to that same point

Help for Medical Personnel and Officials	Mmoa ma Ayaresabea Adwumayɛfo ne Aban Mpanyimfo
To help pediatricians and neonatologists to treat children of Jehovah s Witnesses without blood transfusions Hospital Information Services has produced a triple indexed volume of articles from medical literature that demonstrates what can be done without blood for a host of problems of the newborn

To reach judges social workers children s hospitals neonatologists and pediatricians with information on the available nonblood medical alternatives Jehovah s Witnesses have produced specifically for these medical personnel and officials a page volume called Family Care and Medical Management for Jehovah s Witnesses

Since there has been some misunderstanding about family life among Jehovah s Witnesses it also makes clear the love parents have for their children in a decidedly beneficial caring atmosphere produced by a life style engendered by Bible teaching

He was so impressed with the Family Care volume that he ordered seven additional copies for his colleagues

He now modifies his court orders to balance concerns of the physician with the rights of the parents accomplishing this in two ways

In the process all of American society has benefited
Saa a wɔayɛ no so aba mfaso ama Amerikafo nyinaa
Not only Jehovah s Witnesses but patients in general are today less likely to be given unnecessary blood transfusions because of the work of the Witnesses Hospital Liaison Committees
Ɛnnɛ ɛnyɛ Yehowa Adansefo nko na wɔremma wɔn mogya basabasa na mmom ayarefo nyinaa nso esiane Adansefo no Ayaresabea Ntam Nkitahodi Boayikuw ahorow no dwumadi nti
Patients in general enjoy greater autonomy over a whole range of health care decisions because of the work done by the Witnesses as part of an overall patients rights movement
Ayarefo nyinaa tumi si wɔn nnuruyɛ nyinaa ho gyinae ahorow ankasa esiane Adansefo no dwuma a wɔadi sɛ hokwan a ayarefo wɔ kuw dwumadi no fa no nti
And the causes of freedom in general and religious freedom in particular have been advanced by the Witnesses dedicated resistance to efforts to force them to take action inconsistent with their religious beliefs
Na nea ɛde ahofadi no nyinaa aba titiriw ne nyamesom mu ahofadi a anya nkɔanim no ne Adansefo no ko a wɔako atia mmɔden a wɔabɔ sɛ wɔbɛhyɛ wɔn ma wɔayɛ biribi a ɛne wɔn nyamesom mu gyidi ahorow nhyia no
All this activity by Hospital Liaison Committees may not be directly preaching the good news of God s Kingdom but it is surely answering a direct challenge made to our worship in what the first century governing body called one of the necessary things of our sacred service
Ebia dwuma yi nyinaa a Ayaresabea Ntam Nkitahodi Boayikuw ahorow no adi no mfa asɛmpaka adwuma no ho tee de nanso ɛrema mpoa bi a wɔatwa yɛn som a afeha a edi kan sodikuw no frɛɛ no nea ehia wɔ yɛn som kronn no mu biako ho mmuae
Interestingly however our bold yet dignified outreach to communicate has opened the way for some medical professionals to respond to the Kingdom message
Nanso anigyesɛm ne sɛ akokoduru a nidi wom a yɛde adi nkitaho no abue hokwan ama nnuruyɛfo bi ma wɔagye Ahenni ho nkrasɛm no atom
Several members of Hospital Liaison Committees have started Bible studies with doctors they met through committee activity two of such doctors recently being baptized

So with the help of the Hospital Liaison Committee arrangement Jehovah s Witnesses are being assisted to obey Jehovah s perfect law on abstaining from blood not compromising their integrity and still getting needed medical care
Enti ɛdenam Ayaresabea Ntam Nkitahodi Boayikuw nhyehyɛe no so no wɔaboa Yehowa Adansefo ma wɔadi Yehowa mmara a ɛyɛ pɛ a ɛse wɔntwe wɔn ho mfi mogya ho no so a wonnyaee wɔn mudi mu na wɔda so nya ayarehwɛ a wohia

A Kudu Makes Lions Lose Face	Ɔtorɔm Ma Agyata Anim Gu Ase

Its look was alert and very aggressive so it is little wonder that the local kudu leader took umbrage at this brash invasion of his territory

With his horns down he charged
When he hit the kudu he got the fright of his life

The intruder did not budge
Ɔtorɔm hɔho no antu ne nan
The local kudu bull charged again
Ɔtorɔm nini a ɔwɔ hɔ dedaw no san pem no bio
Still no results

In a frustrated rage and a cloud of dust the local leader broke down all the surrounding trees before moving off
Bere a nkogudi ama ne bo afuw na mfutuma pii aba hɔ no obubuu nnua a ɛbemmɛn hɔ nyinaa ansa na ɔreguan

Ranger Carlson Mathebula reported that lions surrounded the kudu
Mmoa yɛmmea sohwɛfo Carlson Mathebula bɔɔ amanneɛ sɛ agyata betwaa ɔtorɔm nini hɔho no ho hyiae
He said of their encounter with it Suddenly two lionesses began stalking it
Ɔkaa wɔne no ntɔkwaw no ho asɛm sɛ Mpofirim agyata bere abien fii ase to hyɛɛ ne so
With a mighty roar one jumped onto the back of the kudu while the other ran up to its side and lunged at its neck

They both fell to the ground in fright and lay there frozen

Another lioness joined the fray

She ran up to the kudu and with a massive swipe at the legs she tried to bring it down but it just stood there
Ɔde mmirika a emu yɛ den yiye kɔpem ɔtorɔm no nan a na anka ɔde rebɔ mmɔden de no ahwe fam nanso wanka ne ho
The lions became so incensed at their failure to bring this big kudu down that they savaged a rain gauge a garden sprinkler and outdoor furniture before slinking off in disgrace

Some feel like the teenage boy who said I ve tried to talk to my parents about how scared I am about grades and I think this school is too hard but they just tell me I m lazy and should study more
Ebinom te nka te sɛ abarimaa bi a ɔkaa eyi no Mebɔ mmɔden ka sɛnea me ho yeraw me wɔ me sukuu adesua ho ne susuw a misusuw sɛ saa sukuu no mu adesua yɛ den dodo ho asɛm kyerɛ m’awofo nanso nea wɔka ara ne sɛ meyɛ akwadworɔ na ɛsɛ sɛ meyere me ho sua ade
A young Christian girl in Africa expressed a similar concern saying Deep inside me I know that I have personal problems for which I need help but I fear that my parents will not understand me

Of course even God fearing parents fall short at times

Jesus Christ was raised by parents who were less than perfect

If not consider what is said in the book Adolescence by Eastwood Atwater When teenagers become unduly influenced by their peers it is more likely because of something lacking in the parent adolescent relationship than because of the greater attractiveness of peers

It would be a mistake though to conclude that you should give little heed to what your parents say simply because they may not be Christians
Nanso ɛbɛyɛ mfomso sɛ wobɛka sɛ worentie w’awofo asɛm esiane sɛ wɔnyɛ Kristofo nti
They are still your parents and they should be honored as such

When you need spiritual direction try confiding in a trusted member of the Christian congregation

How Complete Is God s Forgiveness ?	Onyankopɔn Fafiri Di Mu Dɛn ?
 I feel that God will never forgive my sins
Mete nka sɛ Onyankopɔn remfa me bɔne ahorow no mfiri me da
He will never want me because of what I did
Gloria
Esiane nea mayɛ nti ɔrennye me da
Gloria
GLORIA had no problem telling others that Jehovah could forgive their sins
NA ƐNYƐ den mma Gloria sɛ ɔbɛka akyerɛ afoforo sɛ Yehowa betumi de wɔn bɔne nyinaa afiri wɔn
But when she reflected on her own mistakes Gloria felt condemned
Nanso bere a Gloria dwennwen n’ankasa mfomso ahorow ho no ɔtee afobu nka
Jehovah s forgiveness seemed unattainable
Na ayɛ sɛ nea ontumi nnya Yehowa hɔ fafiri
Recognition of a wrong act or course of life can agitate the conscience
Hu a obi hu sɛ wayɛ bɔne anaa wafa ɔkwammɔne bi so no betumi ahaw n’ahonim
I was worn out from crying all day long wrote David after he sinned
Bere a Dawid yɛɛ bɔne akyi no ɔkyerɛw sɛ Osu a misu da mu maa me gurowee
My strength was completely drained
Me mu nsu twee
Happily Jehovah delights in pardoning error
Nea ɛyɛ anigye ne sɛ Yehowa ani gye sɛ ɔde bɔne befiri
He is ready to forgive
Psalm Ezekiel
Ɔde bɔne firi
’ Dwom Hesekiel
However Jehovah sees the heart
Nanso Yehowa hwɛ komam
His forgiveness is not based on mere sentiment
Ɛnyɛ nkate so kɛkɛ na ogyina de bɔne firi
The sinner must openly acknowledge his wrong show genuine regret and reject his bad course as something repugnant and hateful
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔnefo no gye ne mfomso tom pefee ɔda nokware ahonu adi na ɔpow ne kwammɔne no sɛ biribi a wokyi na wɔtan
Only then can a wrongdoer be forgiven and experience seasons of refreshing from Jehovah
Acts
Saayɛ so nkutoo na wobetumi de ɔbɔnefo bi mfomso afiri no na wanya ahodwo nna afi Yehowa hɔ
Asomafo no Nnwuma
But even after repenting some still feel condemned
Nanso ebinom kɔ so te afobu nka bere a wɔasakra akyi mpo
Must they carry the burden of guilt forever ?	So ɛsɛ sɛ wɔkɔ so soa afobu nka a wɔte no daa ?
What consolation can be found in the Bible for those who have repented of their sins and left them behind but who still feel plagued at heart ? Psalm
Awerɛkyekye bɛn na yebetumi anya wɔ Bible no mu ama wɔn a wɔanu wɔn ho wɔ wɔn bɔne ho atwe wɔn ho afi ho nanso wɔda so ara di ho yaw wɔ wɔn komam no ? Dwom
Lifting the Weight	Adesoa no Yi
Distressed over his mistakes David prayed to Jehovah See my affliction and my trouble and pardon all my sins
Bere a na Dawid ahaw wɔ ne bɔne ho no ɔbɔɔ Yehowa mpae sɛ Hwɛ m’amane ne m’ahometew na fa me bɔne nyinaa firi me
Here David requested that Jehovah do more than forgive
Ɛha no Dawid hwehwɛe sɛ Yehowa yɛ pii sen bɔne a ɔde bɛkyɛ no ara kɛkɛ
He asked that Jehovah pardon his sins that he lift or bear them carry them off
Ɔsrɛe sɛ Yehowa mfa ne bɔne mfiri ’ no kyerɛ sɛ onyi anaa ɔnsoa mma no
Sin has severe consequences and undoubtedly for David this included the burden of an afflicted conscience
Bɔne de amanehunu pii ba na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔ Dawid fam no na eyi mu biako ne n’ahonim a ɛhaw no
Each year the Israelites were visually reminded that Jehovah could carry away the sins of the nation
Na wɔkae Israelfo no afe biara ma wohu sɛ Yehowa tumi soa ɔman no bɔne kɔ
On Atonement Day the high priest laid his hands upon the head of a goat confessed the sins of the people over it and then sent the goat far off into the wilderness
Mpata Da no na ɔsɔfo panyin no de ne nsa to ɔpapo atifi ka ɔman no bɔne gu no so na afei ogyae no ma ɔkɔ sare so
Anyone present could visualize the removal of the nation s sins
Leviticus
Na onipa biara a ɔwɔ hɔ tumi hu ɔman no bɔne a woyi no
Leviticus
Individuals who have repented of their sins can therefore take comfort
Enti ankorankoro biara a wasakra afi ne bɔne ho betumi anya awerɛkyekye
The proceedings of Atonement Day prefigured a far greater provision for carrying away sin the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ
Nea na wɔyɛ no Mpata Da no twaa ɔkwan a ɛkyɛn so a wɔnam so yi bɔne fi hɔ Yesu Kristo agyede afɔrebɔ no ho mfonini
Isaiah prophetically wrote of Jesus He himself carried the very sin of many people
Yesaia kyerɛw Yesu ho asɛm wɔ nkɔmhyɛ kwan so sɛ Wasoa nnipa bebree bɔne
Hence past sins need not weigh down the conscience
Enti ɛho nhia sɛ obi bɔne dedaw haw n’ahonim
But will Jehovah call these sins to mind at a later time ?	Asɛm no ne sɛ so Yehowa bɛkae saa bɔne ahorow no akyiri nna bi mu ?
Canceling the Debt	Aka a Wotwam
In his model prayer Jesus said Forgive us our debts
Wɔ Yesu mpaebɔ nhwɛso no mu no ɔkae sɛ Fa yɛn aka firi yɛn
The Greek word here translated forgive is a form of a verb that means let go
Hela asɛmfua a wɔkyerɛɛ ase wɔ ha sɛ firi no yɛ adeyɛ asɛm bi a ɛkyerɛ fa kyɛ
Thus forgiveness of sin is likened to letting go of or canceling a debt
Compare Matthew
Enti wɔde bɔne fafiri toto ɛka bi a wɔde kyɛ anaa wotwam ho
Fa toto Mateo ho
Peter enlarged on this when he said Repent therefore and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out
Petro trɛw eyi mu bere a ɔkae sɛ Enti monsakra mo adwene na monnan mo ho na wɔapopa mo bɔne
Blotted out means to destroy or to obliterate
Nea biribi a wɔpopa ’ kyerɛ ne sɛ wɔsɛe no anaa wotu ase
It suggests the erasing of a written record wiping the slate clean
Compare Colossians
Ɛkyerɛ kyerɛwtohɔ bi a wɔpopa aka dedaw a wotwam
Fa toto Kolosefo ho
Therefore those who have repented need not fear that God will demand payment for a debt that he has canceled
Enti ɛho nhia sɛ wɔn a wɔasakra no suro sɛ Onyankopɔn bɛhwehwɛ sɛ wotua ɛka a watwam no
He states Your sins I shall not remember
Ɔka sɛ Wo bɔne nso merenkae
What does this mean for the repentant sinner ?	Dɛn na eyi kyerɛ ma ɔbɔnefo a wasakra n’adwene ?
Removing the Stain	Nkekae no a Wɔpopa
Through the prophet Isaiah Jehovah said Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet they will be made white just like snow though they should be red like crimson cloth they will become even like wool
Isaiah
Yehowa nam ne diyifo Yesaia so kae sɛ Sɛ mo bɔne te sɛ dammaramma a ɛbɛhoa sɛ sukyerɛma sɛ ɛbere sɛ nkranhoma a ɛbɛyɛ sɛ oguan nhwi
Yesaia
Efforts to remove a deep stain from a garment are often futile
Mmɔden a wɔbɔ sɛ wɔbɛpopa nkekae afi ntama mu taa yɛ ɔkwa
At best the stain is dulled but nonetheless noticeable
Nea wotumi yɛ ara ne sɛ wɔbɛma nkekae no so atew nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wotumi hu
How comforting that Jehovah can take sins that are as glaring as scarlet or crimson and make them as white as snow
Compare Psalm
Hwɛ awerɛkyekye a ɛyɛ sɛ Yehowa tumi popa bɔne a ani bere te sɛ dammaramma anaa nkranhoma ma ɛbɛyɛ sɛ sukyerɛmma
Fa toto Dwom ho
Thus a repentant sinner need not feel that he bears a mark for the rest of his life
Enti ɛho nhia sɛ ɔdebɔneyɛfo a wasakra no te nka sɛ nkekae bi wɔ ne ho ne nkwa nna nyinaa mu
Jehovah does not merely dull the errors causing the repentant one to live in perpetual shame
Compare Acts
Yehowa mpopa mfomso ahorow no mma ɛso atew ara kɛkɛ na ama nea wasakra no akɔ so atra aniwu mu daa
Fa toto Asomafo no Nnwuma ho
Support From Others	Mmoa a Efi Afoforo Hɔ
Although Jehovah lifts the weight cancels the debt and removes the stain of sin a repentant one may yet at times feel overwhelmed with remorse
Ɛwom sɛ Yehowa yi adesoa no twa ɛka no mu na oyi bɔne nkekae no de nanso ebia bɔne ho yaw bebunkam nea wasakra n’adwene no so ma wadi ho awerɛhow
Paul wrote about a repentant wrongdoer in the congregation at Corinth who was forgiven by God but who could have been swallowed up by his being overly sad becoming so sad as to give up completely TEV
Corinthians
Paulo kyerɛw ɔdebɔneyɛfo bi a na wasakra wɔ Korinto asafo no mu a na Onyankopɔn de ne bɔne afiri no nanso na anka n’awerɛhow bebrebe no betumi amene no ’ ne werɛ ahow araa ma wapaw aba koraa TEV no ho asɛm
Korintofo
How could this person be helped ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na na wobetumi aboa saa nipa yi ?
Paul continues I exhort you to confirm your love for him
Paulo toa so sɛ Mitu mo fo sɛ munyi ɔdɔ adi nkyerɛ no
The word Paul used for confirm is a legal term meaning to validate
Asɛmfua a Paulo de gyinaa hɔ maa munyi no yɛ asɛmfua a wɔde di dwuma wɔ mmara mu a ɛkyerɛ gye a wogye biribi tom
Yes repentant ones who have the forgiveness of Jehovah also need the validation or stamp of approval from fellow Christians
Yiw wɔn a wɔasakra wɔn adwene a wɔanya Yehowa hɔ fafiri no hia gye a wogye wɔn tom anaa biribi a ɛkyerɛ sɛ wɔpene wɔn so fi wɔn mfɛfo Kristofo hɔ
Understandably this may take time
Ɛda adi sɛ eyi begye bere
The repentant one must live down the reproach of his sin and build up a convincing record of righteousness
Ɛsɛ sɛ nea wasakra n’adwene no tumi ma n’asetra popa ahohorabɔ a ne bɔne no de aba no na ɔda trenee nnwuma adi
He must patiently endure the feelings of any who have been personally affected by his past wrongs
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde boasetɔ gyina ankorankoro biara a ne kan nneyɛe bɔne no haw no no nkate biara ano
Meanwhile he may be confident of Jehovah s complete forgiveness as was David As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset so far off from us Jehovah has put our transgressions
Psalm
Nanso obetumi anya Yehowa hɔ fafiri a edi mu no mu ahotoso sɛnea Dawid nyae no Sɛ apuei ne atɔe ntam ware no sɛ wama yɛn ne yɛn mmarato ntam aware ne no

Can humans solve this dilemma of ethnic strife ?	So nnipa betumi asiw mmusuakuw ntam ntawntawdi mu amanehunu yi ano ?
Concerted Efforts of Humans	Mmɔden Kɛse a Nnipa Abɔ
Consider for example what happened to the efforts in the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union
Sɛ nhwɛso no susuw nea mmɔden a wɔbɔe wɔ kan Yugoslavia ne kan Soviet Union no kowiei no ho
In Yugoslavia was formed in an attempt to unite into one country the various ethnic groups living in southeastern Europe
Wɔ mu no wɔhyehyɛɛ Yugoslavia sɛ wɔde reka mmusuakuw ahorow a wɔtete Europa anafo apuei fam nyinaa abom ayɛ wɔn ɔman biako
The Soviet Union was similarly created by bringing together diverse peoples of various racial religious and national origins
Saa ara na wɔnam nnipakuw ahorow a wofi mmusuakuw nyamesom ne aman ahorow so a wɔkaa wɔn boom so hyehyɛɛ Soviet Union
For many decades both countries had strong central governments holding them together and eventually it seemed that their citizens had learned to live together
Mfe dudu pii mu no na aman abien yi mu biara wɔ aban a ɛyɛ den a ɛka wɔn bom na awiei koraa no ɛkame ayɛ sɛ amanfo no suae sɛ wɔbɛbom atra
The ethnic map of prewar Bosnia and indeed prewar Yugoslavia was like a jaguar s skin explained a leading Serb
Serbiani kannifo bi kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ Nokwarem no wɔhwɛ sɛnea nnipa a wɔka kasa horow adi afra wɔ Bosnia ne Yugoslavia nyinaa ansa na ɔko no resɔre a na ɛte sɛ ɔsebɔ ho
The peoples were inseparably mixed
Na nnipa no adi afra a wontumi nkyekyɛ wɔn mu
In fact about percent of marriages in Yugoslavia were between persons of different ethnic groups
Nokwarem no aware dodow a ɛwɔ Yugoslavia no ɔha biara mu nkyem na ahokafo no mfi abusuakuw biako mu
A similar situation of seeming unity had been created with the mixing of ethnic groups in the Soviet Union
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ tebea a ɛte sɛ nea biakoyɛ wom saa ara na na wɔnam mmusuakuw a wɔaka wɔn ho abom so ahyehyɛ wɔ Soviet Union
Thus the shock was great when after many decades of apparent peace ethnic violence erupted
Enti mmusua ntam basabasayɛ a ɛsɔree bere a na asomdwoe atra hɔ mfe du du pii akyi no yɛɛ ahodwiriw kɛse
Today as one journalist wrote people now chart the makeup of what was Yugoslavia by race religion and nationality
Ɛnnɛ sɛnea nsɛnkyerɛwfo bi kyerɛwee no mprempren nkurɔfo gyina mmusuakuw nyamesom ne beae a amanfo te so kyekyɛ kan Yugoslavia mu
Why when these powerful governments fell did these countries break apart ?	Dɛn nti na bere a aban ahorow a ɛyɛ den no gui no saa aman yi mu paapaee ?
Factors Responsible	Nneɛma a Ɛde Akodi Ba
People do not naturally hate people of another ethnic group
Nnipa mfi awosu mu ntan abusuakuw bi mufo
As a popular song once said you need to be carefully taught before it s too late before you re six or seven or eight to hate all the people your relatives hate
Sɛnea dwom bi a agye din mu nsɛm kyerɛe bere bi no ehia sɛ wɔkyerɛkyerɛ wo yiye ansa na aka akyi dodo ansa na woadi mfe asia anaa ason anaa awotwe na woatan nkurɔfo a w’abusuafo tan wɔn nyinaa
’
This song referred to a young couple with obvious racial differences
Saa dwom yi ka awarefo bi a wonnyinii pii a ɛda adi sɛ womfi abusuakuw biako mu ho asɛm
Yet according to mental health professional Zarka Kovac people in the former Yugoslavia have scarcely any physical differences
Nanso sɛnea adwenem nyarewa ho nimdefo Zarka Kovac kyerɛ no kan Yugoslavia man no mufo nni nipadua mu nsonsonoe biara
Nevertheless the violence is extreme beyond comprehension
Nanso ɛhɔ basabasayɛ no mu yɛ den ara ma enni kabea
You mutilate the person you have killed in order not to recognize your brother Kovac said
Kovac kae sɛ Motetew onipa a moakum no no pasaa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a munhu mo manifo
Clearly such racial and ethnic hatred is not intrinsic to human nature
Ɛda adi pefee sɛ wɔamfa mmusuakuw mu tan a ɛte saa ammɔ nnipa
People have been carefully taught by propagandists and relatives who recount past atrocities
Nnipa bi ne abusuafo a wɔkae nneɛma bɔne a atwam na wɔde ɛho nsɛm ahyɛ nkurɔfo adwenem
Who could be behind it all ?	Hena na ebetumi aba sɛ ɔyɛ eyinom nyinaa farebae ?
Trying to understand the horrors of war a businessman from Sarajevo was moved to conclude After a year of the Bosnian war I believe Satan pulls the strings
Bere a na ɛyɛ den ma adwumawura bi a ofi Sarajevo sɛ ɔbɛte ahude a ɔko no de aba ase no ɛkaa no ma ɔkae sɛ Bere a wɔako Bosnia ko afe akyi no megye di sɛ Satan na ɔsoso gya gu mu
This is pure madness
Eyi yɛ adammɔ ankasa
Although many do not believe in the existence of Satan the Devil the Bible does point to the existence of an invisible superhuman person who has a profoundly negative effect on mankind s behavior
Ɛwom sɛ nnipa pii nnye nni sɛ Satan Ɔbonsam wɔ hɔ ankasa de nanso Bible no ka obi a aniwa nhu no obi a ɔkorɔn sen nnipa a ɔwɔ adesamma nneyɛe so nkɛntɛnso bɔne kɛse ho asɛm
When you think about it about all the irrational prejudice hatred and violence perhaps you may agree that the Bible is really not farfetched when it says The one called Devil and Satan
is misleading the entire inhabited earth
Revelation John
Sɛ wususuw ho a afoforo ho adwemmɔne a ntease nnim ɔtan ne basabasayɛ ho a ebia wubegye Bible no atom sɛ ɛyɛ nokware bere a ɛka sɛ Obi a wɔfrɛ no Ɔbonsam ne Satan

A Ray of Hope	Anidaso ho Hann Bi
When we consider recent world turmoil the dream of a united mankind seems more distant than ever
Sɛ yesusuw basabasa a ɛrekɔ so wɔ wiase nnansa yi no ho a na ayɛ sɛ nea biakoyɛ ho anidaso kakraa bi a adesamma wɔ no mpo atu ayera
Nationalistic and ethnic rivalries threaten man s existence as never before
Ɔmampɛ ne mmusuakuw mu ntawntawdi reyi nnipa hu sen bere biara
Yet in the midst of this global darkness a ray of hope shines brightly
Nanso wɔ wiase nyinaa sum bere yi mu no anidaso ho hann bi hyerɛn pefee
During the summer of a group of people from warring ethnic groups demonstrated a common bond that has allowed them to transcend ethnic strife and to work together in love and unity
Wɔ ahohuru bere mu no nnipakuw bi a wofi mmusuakuw a wɔredi ako no mu daa biribi a ɛka wɔn bom a ama wɔatumi akwati mmusuakuw ntam akodi na wɔabom ayɛ adwuma wɔ ɔdɔ ne biakoyɛ mu adi
Ironically this bond has proved to be the very factor that has often divided mankind religion
Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ne sɛ nea ɛka wɔn bom no ne ade a ɛtaa de mpaapaemu ba adesamma mu nyamesom
Time magazine reported If you scratch any aggressive tribalism or nationalism you usually find beneath its surface a religious core
Time nsɛmma nhoma bɔɔ amanneɛ sɛ Sɛ wohwehwɛ abusuakuw mu nyiyim anaa ɔmampɛ a emu yɛ den mu yiye a wubehu sɛ nyamesom ho asɛm bi wom
Religious hatreds tend to be merciless and absolute
Ɔsom mu nitan taa de atirimɔdensɛm a ɛsen biara na ɛba
In a similar vein India Today said Religion has been the banner under which the most hideous crimes have been perpetrated
Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so no India Today kae sɛ Nyamesom ayɛ frankaa a wɔadi nsɛmmɔne a ɛyɛ hu wɔ ne din mu
It unleashes tremendous violence and is a very destructive force
Ɛde basabasayɛ a emu yɛ den ba na ɛyɛ tumi a ɛsɛe ade yiye
Indeed religion is usually part of the problem not the solution
Nokwarem no nyamesom taa de ɔhaw na ɛba na ɛnyɛ ano aduro
But this one religious group mentioned above a group with substantial numbers has shown that religion can unite not divide
Nanso saa nyamesom kuw a yɛaka ho asɛm wɔ atifi hɔ no kuw a nnipa a wɔwom dɔɔso ara yiye ada no adi sɛ nyamesom betumi de nkabom aba na ɛnyɛ mpaapaemu
Just who make up this group ?	Henanom na wɔbom yɛ saa kuw yi ?
And why have they enjoyed dramatic success where others have failed ?	Na dɛn nti na wɔanya nkɔso kɛse bere a ebinom redi nkogu ?
In answer we invite you to read the following articles
Nea ɛbɛyɛ na woanya eyi ho mmuae no yɛto nsa frɛ wo sɛ kenkan nsɛm a edidi so yi
Doing so may very well give you a new perspective on mankind s future

Unity That Amazes the World	Biakoyɛ a Ɛma Wiase no Ho Dwiriw No
THE world was shocked by the sudden fall of Communism and more recently by the ever increasing ethnic violence
KOMUNISIM a egui mpofirim ne mmusuakuw mu basabasayɛ a ɛrenya nkɔanim nnansa yi maa wiase no ho dwiriw no
Yet at the same time millions in Eastern Europe have been amazed by the united joyous activity of a group that has risen above racial and national animosities Jehovah s Witnesses

Jehovah s Witnesses have succeeded in maintaining united worship even while war raged around them

In when an international crowd of Witnesses met in Zagreb Croatia a policeman said It would be good to show the mass media what is happening in this stadium right here where we see Serbians Croats Slovenians Montenegrins and others sitting next to one another in peace

That same year a newsman at a convention in Siberia saw Russians hugging a newly baptized person of Buryat descent
Saa afe no ara nsɛm ho amanneɛbɔfo bi a na ɔwɔ nhyiam bi ase wɔ Siberia hui sɛ Russiafo yɛɛ obi a na wɔabɔ no asu foforo a ɔyɛ Buryatni atuu
Knowing that real friendships between such diverse peoples are rare he asked How were you able to overcome these national barriers ?

This summer conventions were held by Jehovah s Witnesses in Eastern Europe and Asia the one in Moscow and the one in Kiev being international
Yehowa Adansefo yɛɛ nhyiam horow ahohuru bere yi mu wɔ Europa Apuei ne Asia a na Moscow ne Kiev de no yɛ amanaman ntam de
Altogether over attended the conventions more than in the former Soviet Union and nearly in four cities of the former Yugoslavia

A reporter noted Groups around Sarajevo itself were able to attend

They rented a bus and came

These were from Lukavica Pale Ilidza and Vogosca
Na eyinom fifi Lukavica Pale Ilidza ne Vogosca
Five persons also came from Benkovac

Another point worthy of note is that of the who were baptized at the convention were from these crisis regions

In Moscow and Kiev	Wɔ Moscow ne Kiev
On July the front page of The New York Times had a large picture of Jehovah s Witnesses in Moscow with the caption The unleashing of religion in Russia brought converts into Moscow s Locomotive Stadium for a mass baptism as Jehovah s Witnesses
Wɔ July no The New York Times atesɛm krataa no de Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ Moscow mfonini kɛse bi baa akyi a na wɔakyerɛw ase sɛ Nyamesom hokwan a wɔama wɔ Russia de agyidifo aba Moscow Locomotive Agumadibea ma nnipa pii rebɔ asu sɛ Yehowa Adansefo

In contrast to the usual behavior at Locomotive nobody smokes nobody curses nobody is drunk
Nea ɛne su horow a wɔtaa hu wɔ Locomotive hɔ bɔ abira no wonhu sɛ obiara nom sigaret ka kasa fi anaasɛ wabow nsa wɔ hɔ
For four days Witnesses from Russia and from over other countries comfortably filled the stadium the peak attendance numbering
Adansefo a wofi Russia ne aman afoforo bɛboro so de nnanan yɛɛ nhyiam anigye so wɔ agumadibea hɔ na nnipa dodow a ɛsen biara a wɔbae yɛ
An even larger international convention of Jehovah s Witnesses was held in Kiev the capital of Ukraine
Wɔyɛɛ amanaman ntam nhyiam a na ɛyɛ kɛse koraa no wɔ Kiev Ukraine ahenkurow no mu
There was a peak attendance of assembled in Republican Stadium one of the largest in Eastern Europe

The front page of the Evening Kiev reported Jehovah s Witnesses
are united not only by blue badges with Divine Teaching written on them but by true faith
Atesɛm krataa Evening Kiev bɔɔ amanneɛ wɔ kratafa a edi kan sɛ Ɛnyɛ baagye bruu a wɔakyerɛw Ɔsoro Nkyerɛkyerɛ ’ wɔ so no nkutoo na ɛma Yehowa Adansefo yɛ biako

How Unity Is Achieved	Nea Ɛma Biakoyɛ Ba
How such unity is possible was well illustrated by an elderly Ukrainian Witness at the Kiev convention
Ukraine Ɔdansefo bi a n’ani afi kyerɛkyerɛɛ sɛnea wonya saa biakoyɛ no mu wɔ Kiev nhyiam no ase
She pointed heavenward and said Jehovah
Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ soro kae sɛ Yehowa
Then extending her arms to form a circle she held up a single finger
Afei ɔtenee n’abasam de twaa kɔntɔnkrɔn maa ne nsateaa biako so
Her message was clear We are all one united through the divine teaching of Jehovah God
Na nea ɔrekyerɛ no mu da hɔ fann Yɛn nyinaa yɛ nnipa biako Yehowa Nyankopɔn soro nkyerɛkyerɛ no na aka yɛn abom

Interestingly Encyclop dia Britannica reported on Jehovah s Witnesses in the former Soviet Union showing why the Witnesses are united
Nea ɛyɛ anigye ne sɛ Encyclop dia Britannica de amanneɛbɔ bi mae wɔ kan Soviet Union Yehowa Adansefo ho de kyerɛɛ nea enti a wɔyɛ biako no
It explained They know their Bible based teachings are keen proselytisers and arrange their whole life in accordance with their religious beliefs
Ɛkyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ Wonim wɔn nkyerɛkyerɛ a egyina Bible so no wɔyɛ nkurɔfo a wɔbɔ mmɔden wɔ afoforo a wɔsakra wɔn mu na wogyina wɔn som mu gyidi ahorow so na wɔyɛ wɔn asetra mu biribiara ho nhyehyɛe
How appropriate it was therefore that the theme for this summer s conventions of Jehovah s Witnesses was Divine Teaching !	Enti hwɛ sɛnea na saa Yehowa Adansefo ahohuru bere mu nhyiam ahorow no asɛmti Ɔsoro Nkyerɛkyerɛ no fata !
Jesus Christ who championed divine teaching pointed to an important unifying principle when he prayed regarding his followers They are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world
Yesu Kristo a odii ɔsoro nkyerɛkyerɛ mu akoten no twee adwene kɔɔ biakoyɛ ho nnyinasosɛm titiriw bi so bere a ɔbɔɔ mpae maa n’akyidifo no Womfi wiase sɛnea me nso mimfi wiase no
Yes Jehovah s Witnesses position of neutrality unites them even as Jesus requested when he prayed That they may all be one just as you Father are in union with me and I am in union with you that they also may be in union with us
John
Yiw afa biara a Yehowa Adansefo nni wɔ wiase ntawntawdi mu no ka wɔn bom sɛnea Yesu srɛe bere a ɔbɔɔ mpae no Wɔn nyinaa nyɛ biako sɛnea wo agya wowɔ me mu na mewɔ wo mu sɛ wɔn nso nyɛ biako wɔ yɛn mu

The experience of a delegate from Spain illustrates how being no part of the world unites God s people

En route to the convention in Moscow he sat next to a man from Afghanistan who explained that even people of the same religion were killing one another in the civil war in that country
Ɔnam kwan so rekɔ Moscow no ɔtraa ɔbarima bi a ofi Afghanistan nkyɛn na ɔkyerɛe sɛ nkurɔfo a wɔwɔ nyamesom biako mu mpo rekunkum wɔn ho wɔ ɔmanko a ɛwɔ saa ɔman no mu mu
What political party does your religion advocate ? 	Afei obisae sɛ Amanyɔkuw bɛn na wo som bɔ ho dawuru ? 
he then asked
None was the answer
Onua no buae sɛ yɛmmɔ ebiara ho dawuru
Since Jehovah s Witnesses are politically neutral they are not involved in ethnic fighting which pits one people against another
Esiane sɛ Yehowa Adansefo mfa wɔn ho nhyehyɛ amammuisɛm mu nti wɔmfa wɔn ho nhyɛ mmusuakuw ntam akodi a ɛma onipa bi sɔre tia ɔfoforo no mu
Delegates traveling from a former Soviet republic personally experienced how frightening warfare can be
Nhyiamfo a na wɔretu kwan afi kan Soviet kwasafoman Kazakhstan mu akɔ nhyiam no ankasa huu sɛnea akodi betumi ayɛ hu no
Their train was caught in the midst of gunfire between opposing forces
Wɔn keteke a na wɔte mu no kɔkaa akuw abien a wɔyɛ atamfo a na wɔretoto atuo mfinimfini
How happy they were to arrive safely in Kiev and enjoy the love and unity among the numerous ethnic groups of many nations in the stadium !	Hwɛ sɛnea wɔn ani gyei sɛ wokoduu Kiev dwoodwoo na wokonyaa mmusuakuw ahorow a wofifi aman pii so a wɔwɔ agumadibea hɔ no dɔ ne wɔn biakoyɛ no mu anigye !
A number of German and Russian delegates particularly appreciated what divine teaching had done for them
Nhyiamfo a wofi Germany ne Russia mu dodow bi kyerɛɛ anisɔ titiriw wɔ nea ɔsoro nkyerɛkyerɛ ayɛ ama wɔn no ho
As young men a generation ago they were trying to kill one another during World War II

But during the Kiev convention they were united in true worship as seen on page

Onlookers Were Amazed	Ɛyɛɛ Bɛhwɛadefo Nwonwa
Moscow a city of some nine million previously had little opportunity to become acquainted with Jehovah s Witnesses
Bere bi a atwam no na Moscow kuropɔn a nnipa bɛyɛ ɔpepem akron te mu no mufo nni hokwan kɛse a wɔne Yehowa Adansefo de bɛbɔ fekuw
True many had heard about their persecution and imprisonment under Communism
Nokwarem no na wɔn mu pii ate wɔn taa ne wɔn afiase nna wɔ Komunisim nniso ase no ho asɛm
Also by the summer of this year congregations had been formed in Moscow and in Kiev to accommodate the growing numbers attending the meetings of the Witnesses
Afei ɛde besi ahohuru bere mu wɔ afe yi mu no na wɔahyehyɛ asafo ahorow wɔ Moscow ne wɔ Kiev de agye nnipa pii a wɔkɔ so ba Adansefo no adesua ase no
But now the local people saw tens of thousands of badge wearing delegates at the convention sites and throughout their cities !	Nanso afei de ɛhɔfo no huu nhyiamfo ɔpedudu pii a wɔbobɔ baagye wɔ nhyiambea ahorow ne wɔn nkuropɔn no mu !
Many observers were astonished

The chief fire inspector of Moscow said This convention is most impressive
Moscow odumgya adwuma no panyin kae sɛ Saa nhyiam yi hyɛ nkuran kɛse
It is wonderful that so many people of different nationalities can find a common language
Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ nnipa pii a wofi aman ahorow so tumi nya kasa koro
I am amazed at the cleanliness and orderliness of your people

A visitor to the convention in Kiev exclaimed You are really united

When the Moscow convention began on Thursday July several workmen standing on top of a large construction site nearby were seen momentarily stopping their work

They were apparently impressed by the sound of over voices raised in song
Ɛda adi sɛ nnipa a wɔtoo dwom no nne nnyigyei no na ɛyɛɛ wɔn nwonwa
They would have been even more amazed had they known that the songs were being sung in well over a dozen different languages

The evening before the convention began it didn t get dark until after ten o clock many hundreds of Witnesses from different races and nationalities were there happily embracing

Usually such a large group is here to demonstrate or protest something

Citizens of both Moscow and Kiev were indeed impressed by the thousands of badge wearing delegates excitedly greeting hugging and trying to communicate with one another

He explained that if he did not have to leave the following morning for Iran he would come to the convention

Throughout Moscow and Kiev especially on the streets in the squares and on subway cars convention delegates approached the people to offer Bible tracts and brochures
Wɔ Moscow ne Kiev nyinaa titiriw wɔ mmorɔn so mmeae ahorow a amanfo hyiam ne asase ase keteke mu no nhyiamfo kɔɔ nkurɔfo nkyɛn kɔmemaa wɔn nkratawa ne nhomawa ahorow
Every evening Witnesses could be seen standing near Lenin s Tomb in Red Square quietly conversing and distributing tracts
Na wotumi hu sɛ Adansefo no hyiam wɔ beae bi a ɛbɛn Lenin Aboda so wɔ Red Square a wɔredi nkɔmmɔ brɛoo na wɔrekyekyɛ nkratawa
The offer was usually readily accepted often with a warm smile

If the offer was made on a subway car the person would generally begin reading immediately
Sɛ wɔde kratawa ma obi wɔ asase ase keteke bi mu a na onipa no fi ase kenkan amonom hɔ ara
It was not unusual to see five or six people in a car reading Bible tracts
Na wɔtaa hu sɛ nnipa baanum anaa baasia tete keteke bi mu a wɔrekenkan Bible nkratawa
After reading the message a subway passenger would often express appreciation
Na wɔn a wɔforo keteke no taa kyerɛ anisɔ bere a wɔakenkan asɛm no awie no
We have not had opportunity to learn of such things explained a middle aged man in broken English

In another instance a young man and his mother were so impressed with the message that they got off the subway car at the stop of the convention delegate to continue the conversation
Nkrasɛm no kanyan aberante bi ne ne maame ara ma wosi fii keteke no mu wɔ beae a nhyiamfo sii ne wɔn toaa nkɔmmɔbɔ no so
Kiev was filled with over Witness delegates who had come from over countries all of whom required accommodations

Most stayed in hotels private homes and schools but about were accommodated on six boats
Wɔn mu dodow no traa ahɔhodan afoforo afie ne sukuu mu nanso wɔmaa wɔn mu bɛyɛ dabere wɔ asubɔnten so ahyɛn asia mu
A housekeeper on one of the boats left a note for the Witnesses
Ɔbea bi a osiesie asubɔnten so ahyɛn no biako mu kyerɛw asɛm bi too hɔ maa Adansefo no
She said It seems to me that you have come from another planet
Ɔkae sɛ Ɛyɛ me sɛ mo Adansefo yi fi okyinnsoromma foforo so
You have so much beauty and harmony that you bring a blessing
Mo adeyɛ yɛ fɛ na moyɛ nokoro araa ma mode nhyira ba
It could be you are the children of God
Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mo ne Onyankopɔn mma no
I think about this all the time
Misusuw eyi ho bere nyinaa
How appropriate that Jehovah s Witnesses were able to hold their large conventions and that officials and the people alike could see such fine Christian qualities and conduct that glorify God !	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛfata sɛ Yehowa Adansefo tumi yɛɛ wɔn nhyiam akɛse maa aban mpanyimfo ne amanfo nyinaa nso tumi huu wɔn Kristofo su pa ne nneyɛe ahorow a ɛhyɛ Onyankopɔn anuonyam no !
Local officials who worked with the Witnesses had nothing but praise for their efficiency courtesy and fine cooperation with stadium management and other city departments
Aban mpanyimfo a wɔwɔ mmeae a wɔyɛɛ nhyiam a wɔne Adansefo no yɛɛ adwuma no nni biribi ka gye wɔn ahokokwaw nidi ne biakoyɛ a wɔne agumadibea so ahwɛfo ne kuropɔn mu nnwumayɛbea mpanyimfo afoforo de yɛɛ adwuma no ho nkamfo nkutoo
The stadium has not been cleaned this well for years said an official in Kiev
Aban panyin bi kae wɔ Kiev sɛ Wonsiesiee agumadibea ha yiye sɛɛ wɔ mfe a abɛsen mu
A policeman there exclaimed What people !	Ɛhɔ polisini bi kae sɛ Nnipa bɛn ni !
It s like being in a new world
Ɛte sɛ nea yɛwɔ wiase foforo bi mu
I simply cannot understand why you people were persecuted

Convention Highlights	Nhyiam no ho Nsɛntitiriw
For the Witnesses in Moscow and Kiev the main highlight was perhaps the presence of thousands of delegates from many other lands including members of the Governing Body of Jehovah s Witnesses
Wɔ Moscow ne Kiev Adansefo no fam no ebia nhyiam no ho ade titiriw ne nhyiamfo a wofi aman afoforo pii so bae a na Yehowa Adansefo Sodikuw no mufo bi ka ho no
The joy of just being together united in peaceful worship with so many diverse nationalities was beyond description
Bɔ a wɔne nnipa dodow a wofi aman ahorow so boom hyiae kɛkɛ wɔ ɔsom biakoyɛ mu no maa wonyaa anigye a enni kabea
When the concluding speaker at Moscow and at Kiev said that our chief thanks go to Jehovah God who made the convention possible the audience rose to its feet and erupted in sustained applause for several minutes until the speaker continued his talk
Bere a akasafo a wodi akyiri wɔ Moscow ne Kiev nhyiam ase kae sɛ yɛde aseda kɛse ma Yehowa Nyankopɔn a ɔma yetumi yɛɛ yɛn nhyiam yi no atiefo no sɔre gyinae bɔɔ wɔn nsam simma pii kosii sɛ ɔkasafo no toaa ne kasa so
Other convention highlights were the talks given each day in English by members of the Governing Body and the brief reports delivered by delegates from various lands
Nhyiam no ho nsɛntitiriw foforo nso ne kasa ahorow a Sodikuw no mufo mae wɔ Engiresi kasa mu daa ne amanneɛbɔ ntiantia a na nhyiamfo a wofi aman afoforo so ka kyerɛ no
These English presentations were simultaneously translated into many languages
Wɔkyerɛɛ ɔkasa horow a wɔmae wɔ Engiresi kasa mu no ase kɔɔ kasa ahorow mu bere koro no ara mu
In Kiev for example into !	Sɛ nhwɛso no wɔkyerɛɛ ase kɔɔ kasa ahorow mu bere koro mu wɔ Kiev !
So by sitting in those sections designated for a particular language group delegates could hear that part of the program in their own language
Enti bere a akuw a wɔka kasa pɔtee bi traa beae a wɔde ama wɔn wɔ nhyiam no ase no wotumi tee dwumadi no fa no wɔ wɔn ankasa kasa mu
Still another convention highlight was the release in Russian and Ukrainian of the new brochure What Is the Purpose of Life ?	Nhyiam no ho asɛntitiriw foforo nso ne nhomawa foforo Dɛn ne Asetra Atirimpɔw ? a woyii no adi wɔ Russia ne Ukraine kasa mu no
Especially appreciated was the release in Russian of the Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook which is used to equip Jehovah s Witnesses to present Bible truths more effectively
Nea wɔn ani gyee ho titiriw nso ne Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook a wɔde di dwuma de siesie Yehowa Adansefo ma wotumi ka Bible mu nokware no yiye a woyii no adi wɔ Russia kasa mu no
Also released in Russian was My Book of Bible Stories a concise chronological presentation of Bible history written especially for young people
Nhoma foforo a woyii no adi wɔ Russia kasa mu nso ne Me Nhoma a Ɛka Bible Mu Nsɛm Bible abakɔsɛm ho nsɛm a wɔatwa no tia a wɔkyerɛw maa mmofra titiriw no
Already over million copies of this book have been printed in more than languages
Wɔadi kan atintim saa nhoma yi mfuamfua bɛboro ɔpepem wɔ kasa horow bɛboro mu dedaw
The huge baptism of new disciples was truly a convention highlight
Nokwarem asuafo dodow a wɔbɔɔ wɔn asu no nso yɛ nhyiam no ho asɛntitiriw
The fact that many of those baptized were youths did not go unnoticed
Wohui sɛ wɔn a wɔbɔɔ wɔn asu no mu dodow no ara yɛ mmofra
At a press conference in Kiev a correspondent from the newspaper Osvita asked Noticeable at your convention is the considerable number of young people
Atesɛm krataa Osvita nsɛm ho amanneɛbɔfo bi bisae wɔ nsɛnkyerɛwfo nhyiam bi ase wɔ Kiev sɛ Ade a yehui wɔ mo nhyiam no ase ne mmofra a wɔdɔɔso
They are kind good looking and well behaved
Wɔwɔ ayamye wɔn ho yɛ fɛ na woyi su pa adi
How do you do it ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na mokyerɛkyerɛ wɔn ?
Do you have a special policy for young people ?	So mowɔ nhyehyɛe titiriw bi ma mmofra ?
I work with youths and I would be most interested in knowing
Me ne mmofra yɛ adwuma na m’ani begye kɛse sɛ mehu
Although dedication to God must be based on knowledge not on emotion the actual baptism is still an emotional occasion touching the heart
Ɛwom sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obi ho so a ohyira ma Onyankopɔn no gyina nimdeɛ so na ɛnyɛ nkate so de nanso asubɔ no ankasa da so ara yɛ adeyɛ a ɛka koma
In Moscow the crowd stood and applauded from the time the baptism candidates started moving toward the three baptism pools until all had been baptized more than an hour later
Nnipakuw no sɔre gyinae wɔ Moscow bɔɔ wɔn nsam fi bere a asubɔfo no fii ase de wɔn ani kyerɛɛ nsubura abiɛsa a wɔrekɔbɔ wɔn asu wɔ mu no ho araa kosii sɛ wɔn nyinaa bɔɔ asu wiei nea ɛboro dɔnhwerew biako
In Kiev where over were present six pools were set up for the baptism at one end of the stadium
Wɔ Kiev a nnipa bɛboro hyiaam no wɔyɛɛ nsubura asia wɔ agumadibea no fa bi
With six or more baptizers in each pool the equivalent of a good sized congregation was immersed every two minutes
Bere a wɔbɔɔ nnipa baasia anaa nea ɛboro saa asu bere koro mu wɔ nsubura no mu biara mu no na wɔbɔ nnipa a wɔn dodow bedu asafo mu asu simma abien biara mu
Still the baptism continued for over two hours !	Nanso asubɔ no kɔɔ so ara bɛboro nnɔnhwerew abien !
At the Divine Will International Assembly in New York were baptized
Wɔ Ɔsoro Apɛde Amanaman Ntam Nhyiam ase wɔ New York no wɔbɔɔ nnipa asu
But in Kiev the newly ordained Witnesses of Jehovah from Ukraine and other former republics of the Soviet Union made this the largest Christian baptism on record
Nanso wɔ Kiev no Adansefo afoforo a wofi Ukraine ne kan Soviet Union kwasafoman ahorow so a wɔbɔɔ wɔn asu no yɛ Kristofo abakɔsɛm mu asubɔ a ɛsen biara
These were Russian speaking persons from territories where until just recently Jehovah s Witnesses were banned and had been for decades !	Na eyinom yɛ nkurɔfo a wɔka Russia kasa nkutoo a wofi nsase a na wɔabara Yehowa Adansefo mfe du du pii a nnansa yi ara na wɔrema wɔn hokwan no so !
A highlight of the convention in Belgrade was the presence of delegates from war torn besieged areas
Belgrade nhyiam no asɛntitiriw ne nhyiamfo a wofi amantam a akodi rekɔ so wɔ hɔ bae no
These delegates many times warmly expressed thanks for the privilege extended to them to come to the convention a convention worker reported
Obi a ɔyɛɛ adwuma wɔ nhyiam no ase bɔɔ amanneɛ sɛ Saa nhyiamfo yi de aseda ma mpɛn pii wɔ hokwan a wonya baa nhyiam no bi no ho
However we feel that the real encouragement was for the rest of us who were able to meet them and witness their love and zeal for Bible truth
Nanso yɛte nka sɛ yɛn a yɛaka a yenyaa hokwan hyiaa wɔn na yehuu wɔn dɔ ne wɔn mmɔdenbɔ wɔ Bible mu nokware ho no na yɛanya nkuranhyɛ kɛse
At many of the Divine Teaching Conventions a moving letter written last winter from Sarajevo was read
Wɔkenkan krataa bi a ɛka koma a wɔkyerɛw fii Sarajevo wɔ awɔw bere a etwaam no mu no wɔ Ɔsoro Nkyerɛkyerɛ Nhyiam no mu dodow ase
The temperature is about degrees Fahrenheit C
the writer said
Ɔkyerɛwfo no kae sɛ Ewim ayɛ nwunu ara yiye
I am with my wife and two sons and do not have electricity and not enough firewood
Me ne me yere ne me mma mmarimaa baanu na yɛwɔ ha na yenni anyinam ahoɔden na nnyina a yɛwɔ sua
Machine gun fire and explosions can be heard
Yetumi te atuo a ɛto ntɛmntɛm ne atopae nnyigyei
But in our hearts we are calm and warm because of the truth and because of our good relationship with Jehovah
Nanso yɛwɔ akomatɔyam esiane abusuabɔ pa a yɛne Yehowa wɔ nti
We beg you to keep on praying to Jehovah to help us persist and endure all these terrors firm in faith
Yɛsrɛ sɛ monkɔ so mmɔ Yehowa mpae mma yentumi nnyina saa ahude yi nyinaa ano pintinn wɔ gyidi mu
We are praying for you ! 	Yɛbɔ mpae ma mo ! 
What Difference Does It Make ?	Nkɛntɛnso Bɛn na Enya wɔ Afoforo So ?
When viewed against the backdrop of the disunity manifest among the religions of the world the Witnesses clearly stand in stark contrast
Sɛ wode toto mpaapaemu a ɛwɔ wiase no nyamesom ahorow mu no ho a Adansefo no da nsow koraa
But really what difference can they make ?	Nanso nkɛntɛnso bɛn ankasa na wobetumi anya wɔ nkurɔfo so ?
Concerning a Witness convention years ago an editorial stated Suffice it to say that if all the world lived by the Bible creed of the Jehovah Witnesses there would be an end of bloodshed and hatred and love would reign as king
Atesɛm krataa bi kaa Adansefo nhyiam bi a wɔyɛe mfe bi a atwam ni ho asɛm sɛ Eye ara sɛ yɛbɛka sɛ sɛ wiase no nyinaa de Yehowa Adansefo Bible mmara no retra ase a anka mogyahwiegu ne ɔtan nyinaa bɛba awiei na ɔdɔ adi hene
Yet the majority of mankind have never followed divine teaching
Nanso adesamma mu fa kɛse no ara na wonnii ɔsoro nkyerɛkyerɛ akyi
In the first century they even refused to listen to God s Son Jesus Christ
Wɔ afeha a edi kan no mu no wɔpow sɛ wobetie Onyankopɔn Ba Yesu Kristo asɛm mpo
So is it too much to expect that we will one day see a united world ?	Enti so ɛyɛ den sɛ yɛbɛhwɛ kwan sɛ yebehu wiase bi a biakoyɛ wom da bi ?
How is such a thing possible ?	Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na biribi a ɛte saa atumi aba ?

How the World Will Be United	Sɛnea Wɔbɛma Wiase no Ayɛ Biako
EFFORTS of humans to rule themselves successfully have invariably failed
MMƆDEN biara a nipa abɔ sɛ obedi ne ho so adi nkogu
You will no doubt agree with the inspired assessment Man has dominated man to his injury
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wubegye asɛm a wofi honhom mu kae yi atom Onipa di onipa so tumi ma ɛdan no bɔne
Why have humans failed so miserably at self rule ?	Dɛn nti na nipa adi nkogu a ɛyɛ awerɛhow saa wɔ ne ho so a odi no mu ?
The Bible gives the reason explaining It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step
Bible kyerɛkyerɛ nea enti a ɛte saa no mu sɛ Enni ɔbarima nsam sɛnea ɔnam a obetutu n’anammɔn
No it is not man s prerogative or right to govern either himself or his fellow humans
Dabi enni onipa tumi mu anaa ɛnyɛ hokwan a ɔwɔ sɛ obedi n’ankasa anaa ne mfɛfo nnipa so
It is the special right of Jehovah God our Creator of whom we are told Jehovah is our Judge Jehovah is our Statute giver Jehovah is our King
Isaiah
Ɛyɛ yɛn Bɔfo Yehowa Nyankopɔn a wɔka ne ho asɛm yi kyerɛ yɛn no hokwan titiriw Yehowa ne yɛn temmufo Yehowa ne yɛn mmarahyɛfo Yehowa ne yɛn hene
Yesaia
Only when all humans accept Jehovah God as Ruler will the world be united
Bere a nnipa nyinaa begye Yehowa Nyankopɔn atom sɛ Sodifo no nkutoo na wiase no bɛyɛ biako
But will that ever happen ?	Nanso so ɛbɛba saa da bi ?
Long ago a prophet of God spoke of the final part of the days when many peoples would begin looking to Jehovah for instruction
Tete mmere mu no Onyankopɔn diyifo bi kaa nna a edi akyiri no bere a nnipa pii befi ase ahwehwɛ Yehowa akwankyerɛ akyi kwan ho asɛm
A Foretold Worldwide Peace	Wiase Nyinaa Asomdwoe Ho Asɛm a Wɔaka Ato Hɔ
 It must occur in the final part of the days the prophet Isaiah wrote that the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains
and to it all the nations must stream
Odiyifo Yesaia kyerɛw sɛ Na nna a edi akyiri no mu no Yehowa fi bepɔw no betim hɔ ataa mmepɔw atifi
na amanaman nyinaa asen yuu aba ho
And many peoples will certainly go and say Come you people and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah to the house of the God of Jacob and he will instruct us about his ways
Na aman pii bɛkɔ akɔka sɛ Mommra mma yɛnkɔ Yehowa bepɔw so nkɔ Yakob Nyankopɔn fi na ɔnkyerɛ yɛn n’akwan
When we read further we see the result of looking to Jehovah for instruction
Sɛ yɛtoa so kan a yehu nea efi Yehowa akwankyerɛ akyi kwan a wɔhwehwɛ mu ba no
They will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears the prophecy continues
Nation will not lift up sword against nation neither will they learn war anymore
Isaiah
Nkɔmhyɛ no toa so sɛ Na wɔde wɔn nkrante abobɔ nsɔw ne wɔn mpeaw ayeyɛ nnare ɔman bi remma afoa so nhyɛ ɔman bi na wɔrensua akodi bio
Yesaia
Yes the result of heeding this divine teaching would be no more fighting no more ethnic violence no more war
Yiw nea ebefi saa ɔsoro nkyerɛkyerɛ yi sodi mu aba ne ntɔkwako mmusuakuw ntam basabasayɛ ne akodi a ɛremma bio
Human rulers assumed that they could fulfill this Bible prophecy and even inscribed the last portion of it on a wall of the United Nations Plaza in New York City
Nnipa sodifo susuw sɛ wobetumi ama saa nkɔmhyɛ yi abam na wɔakyerɛw ne fa a etwa to no agu Amanaman Nkabom no abɔnten so ɔfasu ho wɔ New York kuropɔn no mu mpo
Yet war and hatred among national and ethnic groups has only increased right up to the end of
Nanso aman ne mmusuakuw mu akodi ne nitan akɔ soro ankasa abedu awiei
So would you say God s prophecy has failed ?	Enti wobɛka sɛ Onyankopɔn nkɔmhyɛ annya mmamu ?
No it has not for people from among all the nations are right now streaming to Jehovah s house to receive divine teaching
Dabida efisɛ nnipa a wofi aman nyinaa mu rekɔ Yehowa fie akogye ɔsoro nkyerɛkyerɛ mprempren yi ara
Indeed what a grand testimony this summer s Divine Teaching Conventions of Jehovah s Witnesses have been in fulfillment of this prophecy !	Nokwarem no saa nkɔmhyɛ yi mmamu ho adanse a ɛso nni bɛn na saa Yehowa Adansefo Ɔsoro Nkyerɛkyerɛ Nhyiam horow a wɔyɛe wɔ ahohuru bere mu no ayɛ !
The worldwide brotherhood of Jehovah s Witnesses allow nothing neither race nationality nor ethnic background to cause them to hate or kill one another
Yehowa Adansefo onuadɔ kuw a ɛwɔ wiase nyinaa no mma biribiara kwan honam ani hwɛbea ɔman anaa abusua a wofi mu mma ɛmfa ɔtan mma wɔn ntam anaa wonkunkum wɔn ho wɔn ho
They have figuratively beaten their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears
Wɔde wɔn nkrante abobɔ nsɔw de wɔn mpeaw ayeyɛ nnare wɔ sɛnkyerɛnne kwan so
But someone may object you can t expect everyone to heed God s instruction to love one another
Nanso ’ ebia obi bɛka sɛ wuntumi nhwɛ kwan sɛ obiara bedi Onyankopɔn akwankyerɛ a ɛne sɛ yɛnnodɔ yɛn ho no akyi
’
Although this is true God has the power to remove all opposers of his divine will
Ɛwom sɛ eyi yɛ nokware de nanso Onyankopɔn wɔ tumi a ɔde beyi wɔn a wɔsɔre tia ne soro apɛde no nyinaa afi hɔ
What God Will Do	Nea Onyankopɔn Bɛyɛ
Do you pray as Jesus taught his followers namely Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven ?	So wobɔ mpae sɛnea Yesu kyerɛɛ n’akyidifo no sɛ Yɛn Agya a wowɔ soro wo din ho ntew w’ahenni mmra nea wopɛ nyɛ asase so sɛnea ɛyɛ ɔsoro no ?
If you do you can be confident that our loving heavenly Father will answer that prayer
Sɛ woyɛ saa a wubetumi anya ahotoso sɛ yɛn soro Agya a ɔwɔ dɔ no bebua saa mpae no
How will he do that ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na ɔbɛyɛ saa ?
God has already appointed his Son The Prince of Peace as the chosen ruler of his government the Kingdom for which we were taught to pray
Onyankopɔn apaw ne Ba Asomdwoe hene no dedaw sɛ n’aban Ahenni a wakyerɛ yɛn sɛ yɛmmɔ ho mpae no sodifo
We need such a superhuman spirit ruler for only he can rid humankind of the evil influence of Satan and his demons
Yehia honhom mu nipa a ɔkorɔn a ɔte saa efisɛ ɔno nkutoo na obetumi ama adesamma ade wɔn ho afi Satan ne n’adaemone nkɛntɛnso bɔne no ase
Human rulers no matter how well meaning cannot do so
John Revelation
Ɛmfa ho adwempa biara a wɔwɔ no nnipa sodifo biara ntumi nyɛ eyi
Yohane Adiyisɛm
Yet what will happen to present day governments that fail to submit to divine rulership ?	Nanso dɛn na ɛbɛba nnɛyi aban ahorow a wɔpow sɛ wɔbɛbrɛ wɔn ho ase ahyɛ ɔsoro nniso ase no so ?
Another Bible prophecy that describes the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray says The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin
God s heavenly Kingdom will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms and it itself will stand to times indefinite
Bible nkɔmhyɛ foforo a ɛka Ahenni a Yesu kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ yɛmmɔ ho mpae ho asɛm no ka sɛ Ɔsoro Nyankopɔn bɛma ahenni a wɔrensɛe no da
bi so na Onyankopɔn soro Ahenni no bebubu ahenni horow no nyinaa ama asa na ɛno de ebegyina daa
’
Thus praying for God s Kingdom to come means that we are praying for one worldwide government under the rule of the Prince of Peace
Daniel Isaiah
Enti sɛ yɛbɔ Onyankopɔn Ahenni no ho mpae sɛ ɛmmra a na ɛkyerɛ sɛ yɛrebɔ wiase nyinaa aban biako a ɛwɔ Asomdwoe hene no nniso ase ho mpae
Daniel Yesaia
Then when the human family is united in peace under God s Kingdom all will love one another regardless of race or ethnic background
Afei bere a adesamma abusua ayɛ biako wɔ asomdwoe mu wɔ Onyankopɔn Ahenni ase no obiara bɛdɔ ne yɔnko a honam ani hwɛbea anaa kasa a ɔka mfa ho
What a glorious time that will be !	Anuonyam bere bɛn na ɛbɛyɛ sɛɛ yi !
We invite you to enjoy a preview of that peaceful situation even now among Jehovah s Witnesses and then to look forward with them to the time when the whole world will be united in peace

Bere a me papa teɛɛ ne nsa sɔɔ me mu ma mifii ɔtare a wɔbɔɔ me asu wom mu no anigye maa nusu guu no

Sadly however the unity of our family in Christian worship would soon be shattered

Eastern Western Background	Apuei ne Atɔe Asetra
My father Lester was born in Hong Kong in March
Wɔwoo me papa Lester wɔ Hong Kong March mu
His dad was the assistant harbormaster
Na ne papa ne hyɛngyinabea sohwɛfo no abadiakyiri
When Father was a boy his dad would take him along on trips by boat to check on activities around Hong Kong and nearby islands
Bere a Paapa yɛ abofra no na ne papa de no tra ahyɛmma mu tu kwan kɔhwɛ sɛnea nneɛma rekɔ so wɔ Hong Kong ne nsupɔw a ɛbemmɛn hɔ no so
Then when Lester was only eight his dad died
Afei bere a na Paapa adi mfe awɔtwe pɛ no ne papa wui
Afterward his mother remarried and the family moved to Shanghai
Ɛno akyi no ne maame waree foforo na abusua no tu kɔɔ Shanghai
In his mother took Lester and his ten year old sister Phyl to England for schooling
Wɔ mu no ne maame de ɔne ne nuabea Phyl a na wadi mfe du kɔɔ sukuu wɔ England
Father spent the following years in the shadow of Canterbury Cathedral home of the Anglican Church
Paapa traa beae bi a ɛbɛn Anglikanfo asɔredan kɛse a ɛwɔ Canterbury no
Attending church there was his introduction to religious matters
Ɛno ne asɔre a odii kan kɔe
Phyl went to a boarding school north of London but she and Father became very close during those years because they spent their school holidays together

Five years later in when Father finished school his mother returned to England and saw to it that Lester became established in business
Bere a Paapa wiee sukuu mfe anum akyi wɔ mu no ne maame san kɔɔ England na ɔhwɛ hui sɛ Paapa afi adwuma ase
Then the following year she went back to Shanghai taking Phyl with her
Afei afe a edi hɔ no ne maame ne Phyl san kɔɔ Shanghai
Before Lester s mother left she gave him a copy of a book written by his great grandfather
Paapa maame rebɛkɔ no ɔmaa no nhoma bi a ne nana bi na ɔkyerɛwee
It was a poetic story of the life of Buddha entitled The Light of Asia
Na ɛyɛ Buddha asetra ho anwensɛm bi a wɔato din The Light of Asia
This started Father thinking about the real reason for life
Eyi maa Paapa susuw dekode a asetra atirimpɔw yɛ ankasa ho
At Canterbury he had been impressed with the grandeur of the cathedral and the solemnity of the religious proceedings but the lack of spiritual instruction left him with an empty feeling
Bere a na ɔwɔ Canterbury no n’ani gyee asɔredan no kɛse ne ahofama a wɔdaa no adi wɔ nyamesom amane ahorow mu no ho nanso honhom mu nkyerɛkyerɛ a na enni hɔ no ma ɔyɛɛ basaa
So he wondered Do the Eastern religions have the answers ? 	Enti osusuw ho sɛ So Apuei Fam asɔre ahorow no wɔ mmuae no ? ’
He decided to investigate
Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛhwehwɛ mu
During the years that followed he looked into Buddhism Shintoism Hinduism Confucianism and Islam
Mfe a edi hɔ mu no ɔhwehwɛɛ Buddhasom Shintosom Hindusom Konfusiosom ne Nkramosom mu
But each failed to answer his questions

Father lived at a sports club operated by the firm he worked for and he enjoyed rowing playing rugby and other sports
Na Paapa te agodibea bi a ɛyɛ adwuma a na ɔwom no de na onyaa korow hare bɔɔlbɔ ne agumadi afoforo mu anigye
He soon fell in love with Edna an attractive girl who had the same love of sports
Ankyɛ na n’ani begyee Edna ɔbea hoɔfɛfo bi a na ɔno nso pɛ agumadi saa ara ho
They were married in and were blessed with four sons over the next ten years

Traumatic War Years	Ɔko Bere mu Ahoyeraw
During the s the storm clouds of World War II were gathering so Father decided to move from London to the country
Wɔ mfe no mu no na nneɛma pii di adanse sɛ Wiase Ko II reba enti Paapa sii gyinae sɛ obetu afi London akɔtra akuraase
We made the move only a few months before the war broke out in September
Yetu fii hɔ no ankyɛ na ɔko no fii ase wɔ September mu
Conscription for war services was introduced and age limits were gradually raised as the war dragged on
Wofii ase faa nkurɔfo tetee wɔn maa akodi na bere a ɔko no kɔɔ so no wɔtoo mfe a ɛsɛ sɛ obi di ansa na wafata akodi no so
Rather than waiting to be conscripted Father volunteered for service in the Royal Air Force and was called up in May
Sɛ anka Paapa bɛtwɛn ma wɔafa no no otuu ne ho mae sɛ wɔmfa no wɔ Royal Air Force no mu na wɔfaa no May
Although he was occasionally able to get home on leave it was six years before normal family relationships were resumed
Ɛwom sɛ ɛtɔ mmere bi a na ɔba fie begye n’ahome de nanso edii mfe asia ansa na ɔresan ne abusua no anya abusuabɔ a ɛsɛ
The burden of caring for us children the two oldest of us were by then entering our teens fell upon Mother

Spiritual Refreshment	Honhom mu Ahotɔ
About two years before Father was released from the Air Force two of Jehovah s Witnesses called on Mother and started a Bible study with her
Bɛyɛ mfe abien ansa na Paapa regyae Air Force adwuma no Yehowa Adansefo baanu baa Maame nkyɛn ne no befii Bible adesua ase
Mother wrote Father and told him how much she was enjoying what she was learning
Maame kyerɛw Paapa ka kyerɛɛ no sɛ n’ani gye nea ɔresua no ho
Once when he was on leave she took him to a congregation Bible study in a private home
Bere bi a na waba fie rebegye n’ahome no Maame de no kɔɔ asafo Bible adesua bi ase wɔ obi fie
Father was released from the military in December and began sitting in on the Bible discussions Mother was having with the two Witness ladies
Paapa gyaee sraadi December na ofii ase traa Bible adesua a na Adansefo mmea baanu ne Maame yɛ no mu
They noted his interest and had Ernie Beavor the presiding overseer visit Father
Wohui sɛ n’ani gye ho no wɔmaa Ernie Beavor ɔhwɛfo guamtrani no bɛsraa Paapa
In just one evening Brother Beavor answered from the Bible all Father s objections
Onua Beavor fi Bible no mu buaa Paapa nsemmisa nyinaa anadwo biako pɛ
During the next two weeks while traveling to work in London each day by train he read the three books Brother Beavor gave him
Paapa de adapɛn abien a edi hɔ no kenkan nhoma abiɛsa a Onua Beavor de maa no no na na ɔyɛ saa bere a ɔte keteke mu rekɔ adwuma wɔ London da biara
When Brother Beavor visited again Father greeted him This is the truth I have been searching for !	Bere a Onua Beavor san baa hɔ no asɛm a edi kan a epue fii Paapa ano ne sɛ Eyi ne nokware a merehwehwɛ no !
What must I do ? 	Dɛn na menyɛ ? 
From then on Father began taking us boys to the meetings
Efi saa bere no Paapa fii ase de yɛn mmarimaa no kɔɔ adesua horow
Mother however did not always want to come with us
Nanso ɛnyɛ da biara na Maame pɛe sɛ ɔne yɛn kɔ
Her interest had begun to wane
N’anigye no fii ase brɛɛ ase
Yet all of us went to the convention in London in July where Father and I were baptized
Nanso yɛn nyinaa kɔɔ London nhyiam no wɔ July na ɛhɔ na wɔbɔɔ me ne Paapa asu
Afterward Mother only occasionally came to meetings
Ɛno akyi no na Maame kɔ adesua nnakoro nnakoro
Shortly after that baptism my aunt Phyl came to England to visit and to my father s great joy readily accepted Bible truth and was baptized
Wɔbɔɔ yɛn asu akyi no ankyɛ na me sewa Phyl bɛsraa yɛn wɔ England na ogyee Bible mu nokware toom ntɛmntɛm ma wɔbɔɔ no asu maa Paapa ani gyee yiye
When she returned to Shanghai she contacted Stanley Jones and Harold King two missionaries of Jehovah s Witnesses who had been sent there shortly before
Bere a ɔsan kɔɔ Shanghai no okohuu Stanley Jones ne Harold King Yehowa Adansefo asɛmpatrɛwfo baanu a na wɔaba hɔ foforo
These missionaries were later imprisoned for seven years and five years respectively by the ruling Communist government
Akyiri yi Komunis nniso no de saa asɛmpatrɛwfo yi too afiase maa obiako nyaa mfe ason na nea ɔka ho no nso nyaa mfe anum
They helped Phyl spiritually until her husband retired from work in China
Wɔde honhom fam mmoa maa Phyl kosii sɛ ne kunu gyaee adwuma a na ɔyɛ wɔ China no
Then she and her husband returned to England and settled near us
Afei ɔne ne kunu san baa England na wɔbɛtraa baabi a ɛbɛn yɛn fie hɔ
A Tragic Family Breakup	Abusua Ntetewmu a Ɛyɛ Awerɛhow
Meanwhile real communication between Mother and Dad became a problem
Saa bere no na Maame ne Paapa ntumi nni nkitaho sɛnea ɛsɛ
Mother saw the zeal with which Lester pursued his newfound faith and believing that the material security of the family would be threatened she began to oppose his Christian activity
Maame huu sɛnea Paapa de nsi dii ne gyidi foforo no akyi na esiane sɛ na ogye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ asiane ama abusua no honam fam ahiade nti ofii ase sɔre tiaa ne Kristofo dwumadi no
Finally in September she confronted him with the ultimatum that he give up the Christian faith or else she would leave
Awiei koraa wɔ September no ɔde too Paapa anim sɛ sɛ wannyae ne Kristofo gyidi no mu a obefi fie hɔ
Father felt that he had calmed Mother s fears by reasoning with her from the Scriptures showing her that there was no reason to fear
Esiane sɛ na Paapa fi Kyerɛwnsɛm mu ne Maame asusuw nsɛm ho na wakyerɛ no sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛma ne bo tu nti na osusuw sɛ wama ne koma atɔ ne yam
However the climax came without further warning on October
Nanso biribi a ɔnhwɛ kwan bae prɛko pɛ wɔ October
When Father arrived home from work that day he found an empty house and me sitting on the doorstep with our suitcases
Saa da no bere a Paapa fi adwuma baa fie no na obiara nni fie hɔ na na aka me nko ara te apongua no ano a yɛn nnaka sisi me nkyɛn
Mother had left taking everything including my three brothers
Na maame afa biribiara a ɛwɔ fie hɔ kɔ a me nua mmarima baasa nso ka ho
I told father that I had chosen to stay with him
Meka kyerɛɛ Paapa sɛ me de me ne no bɛtra
Mother had not even left a note
Matthew

Ernie Beavor made arrangements for us to stay with an older couple until Father found accommodations
Ernie Beavor yɛɛ nhyehyɛe ma yɛne awarefo bi a wɔn mfe akɔ anim kɔtrae kosii sɛ Paapa nyaa dan
They were very kind to us and comforted us with the apostle Paul s words at Corinthians If the unbelieving one proceeds to depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not in servitude under such circumstances but God has called you to peace
Woyii ayamye adi kyerɛɛ yɛn na wɔde ɔsomafo Paulo nsɛm a ɛwɔ Korintofo yi kyekyee yɛn werɛ sɛ Na nea onnye nni no tew mu kɔ a ma ɔnkɔ na wɔnhyɛ onua ko anaa onuawa ko no so sɛ akoa saa nsɛm yi mu
Na asomdwoe mu na Onyankopɔn afrɛ yɛn
We eventually made contact with our family and visited them but soon realized that compromising our faith would be the only acceptable solution to Mother
Awiei koraa no yɛne yɛn abusua no nyaa nkitahodi na yɛkɔsraa wɔn nanso ankyɛ na yehui sɛ nea Maame hwehwɛ ara ne sɛ yebegyae yɛn gyidi no mu
We knew that making concessions would not bring blessings from Jehovah
Na yenim sɛ yɛn gyidi mu a yebegyae de asɔ n’ani no remma yennya Yehowa nhyira
So Father continued in secular work providing Mother with the financial means to support my brothers
Enti Paapa kɔɔ so yɛɛ honam fam adwuma na ɔmaa Maame sika a ɔde bɛhwɛ me nuanom no
On leaving school in I took part time work and in January I was accepted for the full time ministry

A Memorable Bible Discussion	Bible Nkɔmmɔbɔ a Me Werɛ Remfi
In field ministry one day when I was still only I spoke with a man in a farm cottage
Ɛda bi bere a na madi mfe pɛ no me ne ɔbarima bi bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ wɔ asɛnka mu wɔ akuraa bi ase
While I was visiting there Winston Churchill Britain s leader during World War II arrived
Bere a na merekɔ hɔ no Winston Churchill a na ɔyɛ Britain ɔman panyin wɔ Wiase Ko II bere mu no baa hɔ
My conversation was interrupted but Mr
Churchill took note of The Watchtower and commended me for my work
Eyi twaa nkɔmmɔbɔ no so nanso bere a Owura Churchill huu Ɔwɛn Aban no ɔkamfoo me wɔ adwuma a mereyɛ no ho
Several days later I was out preaching again when I rang the doorbell of a large house
Nna bi akyi no na mereyɛ asɛnka adwuma no bio na mekɔbɔɔ ofie kɛse bi pon mu
A butler opened the door and when I requested to speak to the man of the house he asked if I knew who that was
Ofiehwɛfo bi bebuee pon no na bere a mekae sɛ mepɛ sɛ me ne ofiewura no kasa no obisaa me sɛ minim onii ko no anaa
I had no idea
Na minnim no
This is Chartwell he said the home of Winston Churchill
Ɔkae sɛ Ɛha yɛ Chartwell Winston Churchill fie
At that moment Mr
Churchill appeared
Saa bere no Owura Churchill pue bae
He remembered our previous meeting and invited me in
Ɔkaee sɛ yɛahyia pɛn na ɔkae sɛ memmra mu
We spoke a little and he accepted three books and invited me to return

Later on a warm afternoon I returned and was again invited in
Da ko awia bi mesan kɔɔ hɔ na ɔsan frɛɛ me kɔɔ dan mu
Mr
Churchill offered me some lemonade and after a brief greeting said I will give you half an hour to tell me what you think God s Kingdom is but then you must let me tell you what I believe it to be
Owura Churchill maa me anonne dɔkɔdɔkɔ bi na ɔmaa me akwaaba tiawa wiei no ɔkae sɛ Mɛma wo simma aduasa ma wode aka nea wususuw sɛ Onyankopɔn Ahenni yɛ ho asɛm akyerɛ me nanso ma minni kan nka nea migye di sɛ ɛyɛ nkyerɛ wo
That is what we did
Saa ara na yɛyɛe
Mr
Churchill felt that God s Kingdom would be established through God fearing statesmen and that until men learned to live at peace it would never come
Na Owura Churchill susuw sɛ wɔnam amanyɛfo a wosuro Onyankopɔn so na wɔde Onyankopɔn Ahenni besi hɔ na sɛ nnipa ansua sɛ wɔbɛtra asomdwoe mu a ɛremma da

Mr
Churchill was very cordial and indicated he respected our work

Unfortunately I was never again able to contact him
Nea ɛyɛ yaw ne sɛ me ne no anhyia bio
But I am grateful that even though I was still a teenager with the training and encouragement I had received from my father I was able to give a good witness to such a prominent world statesman

An Expanded Ministry	Ɔsom Adwuma a Emu Trɛw
In May Mother wrote to tell us that she was immigrating to Canada and would be taking with her John my youngest brother
Wɔ May no Maame kyerɛw yɛn ka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ ɔretu akɔ Canada na ɔde me nua kumaa koraa a wɔfrɛ no John bɛkɔ
By then my brothers Peter and David were caring for themselves
Saa bere no na me nuanom Peter ne David atew wɔn ho
So after years with his firm including the war years when he was kept on their list of employees Father handed in his resignation and applied for the regular pioneer service
Enti bere a Paapa yɛɛ n’adwuma no mfe a mfe a wodii ako wom a na ne din da so ara ka ɛhɔ adwumayɛfo ho no ka ho no ogyaee adwuma no na ɔkyerɛw hwehwɛɛ daa akwampae som adwuma no ho kwan
He began the full time ministry in August after he returned from attending the huge international convention of Jehovah s Witnesses in New York
Ofii ase yɛɛ bere nyinaa ɔsom adwuma no August bere a ofi Yehowa Adansefo amanaman ntam nhyiam kɛse a wɔyɛɛ no New York bae no
A little over a year later in November Father was appointed a traveling overseer and began visiting congregations to encourage them
Afe biako ne kakra akyi wɔ November mu no wɔpaw Paapa sɛ ɔhwɛfo kwantufo ma ofii ase kɔsrasraa asafo ahorow hyɛɛ wɔn nkuran
Meanwhile in the fall of I was invited to serve at the branch office of Jehovah s Witnesses in London England
Na me nso wɔ ofupɛ bere mu no wɔpaw me sɛ memmɛsom wɔ Yehowa Adansefo baa dwumadibea a ɛwɔ London England hɔ
Then came another rich blessing Father and I were invited to the th class of the Gilead missionary school in New York
Afei nhyira a ɛyɛ anigye foforo bae wɔtoo nsa frɛɛ me ne Paapa sɛ yɛmmra Gilead asɛmpatrɛw sukuu no adesuakuw a ɛto so no bi wɔ New York
The class started in September and we graduated the following February
Adesua no fii ase September na yewiee afe a edi hɔ no February mu
Afterward I served at the world headquarters of Jehovah s Witnesses in Brooklyn New York while father was sent out as a traveling overseer in Indiana

The whole th class was held back from going to our missionary assignments so that we could attend the international convention in New York City in July

I had become very fond of one of my classmates Kae Whitson and we decided to get married
Na m’ani abegye m’adesuakuw no muni biako Kae Whitson ho kɛse na yesii gyinae sɛ yɛbɛware
We were assigned to the traveling work in Michigan and then two years later we were given a missionary assignment in Northern Ireland

However just as we were due to sail Kae discovered she was pregnant

So we began another assignment that of raising a son and three daughters to become successful full time ministers even as my father had trained me to be

In November Father left for Africa and on January he arrived at his missionary assignment in Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe
Wɔ November mu no Paapa kɔɔ Afrika na wɔ January no okoduu Southern Rhodesia mprempren Zimbabwe kɔyɛɛ n’asɛmpatrɛw adwuma no wɔ hɔ
Father had much to learn a new way of life new customs and new tests of faith

Back in Southern Rhodesia had not been affected much by Western ways

After a year in the branch office Father was sent out in the traveling work as a district overseer

After leaving England Mother stayed a while in Canada and then moved to the United States with John
Bere a Maame fii England no ɔkɔtraa Canada kakra na afei ɔne John tu kɔɔ United States
None of my brothers have become Witnesses

However Mother was contacted by the Witnesses in the mid s

But the next year she had a nervous breakdown

My brothers Peter and David arranged for her to go to England where she received treatment
Me nuanom Peter ne David yɛɛ nhyehyɛe maa no kɔɔ England na wɔhwɛɛ no yare wɔ hɔ
She recovered and again began studying with the Witnesses
Ne ho tɔɔ no ma ɔsan ne Adansefo no fii ase suaa ade
You can imagine my father s joy when she wrote to tell him that she was to be baptized at a convention in London in
Wubetumi asusuw sɛnea me papa ani gyei bere a me maame kyerɛw bɛka kyerɛɛ no sɛ wɔbɛbɔ no asu wɔ nhyiam bi ase wɔ London no
My wife and I flew over from the United States to be with her at the time of her baptism

The following year Father was due for a vacation and when in England he had the joy of working with Mother from house to house in the ministry

Afterward he came to visit our family in the United States

Father and Mother had discussed reconciliation but she told him We ve been apart too long

It would be difficult
Ɛbɛyɛ den

So Father returned to his assignment

Mother s illness in Kenya left its mark on her and eventually she had to be confined to a hospital where she died in
Ɔyare a ɛbɔɔ Maame wɔ Kenya no kaa no kɛse na awiei koraa no wogyee no too ayaresabea bi kosii sɛ owui wɔ mu
In Father became very sick so my brother Peter and I visited him at his home in Zimbabwe

This encouraged him greatly and seemed to give him a new lease on life

Women Advised to Resist a Rapist	Wotu Mmea Fo Sɛ Wɔnko Ntia Mmonnaatofo
New research has shown that women have a better chance of escaping rape and injury if they fight back than if they plead or cry
Nhwehwɛmu foforo ada no adi sɛ sɛ mmea ne mmonnaatofo pere so mmom sen sɛ wɔbɛpa kyɛw anaa wobesu a wobetumi akwati mmonnaato ne pira
Examining records of women who had been sexually attacked researchers at Brandeis University in Waltham Massachusetts discovered that women who fought back or screamed and ran away fared much better than those who did not
Bere a nhwehwɛmufo rehwehwɛ mmea a nkurɔfo bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛto wɔn mmonnaa ho kyerɛwtohɔ ahorow mu wɔ Brandeis Sukuupɔn a ɛwɔ Waltham Massachusetts no wohui sɛ mpɛn pii no mmea a wɔko tiae anaa wɔteɛteɛɛm na woguanee no nyaa wɔn ho sen wɔn a wɔanyɛ saa no
In fact the women most apt to be raped or harmed were those who didn t fight back relying instead on begging or reasoning with their attackers says the magazine American Health

The Church in Poland	Poland Asɔre No
Some four years after the fall of Communism in Poland the Catholic Church is facing serious difficulties
Bɛyɛ mfe anan ni a Komunis nniso gui wɔ Poland no Katolek Asɔre no rehyia ɔhaw a emu yɛ den
According to the Guardian Weekly of London public opinion polls reveal that the priesthood has lost much of its prestige status
Sɛnea London Gaurdian Weekly no kyerɛ no nsɛm a wobisabisaa ɔmanfo da no adi sɛ asɔfo ahwere wɔn dibea a nidi wom no fa kɛse no ara
It adds that the number of seminary applicants is falling off and attendances at religious instruction classes in schools are dwindling

The majority of those questioned believe that Catholic influence on public life is excessive
Wɔn a wobisabisaa wɔn nsɛm no mu dodow no ara gye di sɛ Katoleksom nya ɔmanfo asetra so nkɛntɛnso dodo
The Guardian notes that Polish intellectuals believe that although in the past Poland acquired a reputation for religious fervour its Catholicism was in fact only skin deep and ritualistic

Some are convinced that the church was mainly an instrument to fight Communism and that it did not stop Polish Catholics from divorcing or having abortions while the law still allowed them to

Seven years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine doctors in Belarus formerly Belorussia are reporting a substantial increase in the number of thyroid cancers in children

Because the radioactive isotope that causes thyroid cancer iodine was released in the accident in far larger quantities than other radioactive elements scientists are hoping that other types of radiation induced cancers will be limited

Many insurance companies thus offer women drivers better rates than men
Enti insurance adwumayɛ pii ma mmea a wɔka kar insurance akɛse sen mmarima
This confidence in women s driving skills explains the above magazine exists because the industry believes that women are less aggressive behind the wheel less inclined to take risks and less likely to be involved in traffic offences

 Mom and Dad had been taking me to Christian meetings and I knew right from wrong admits Robert

But I wanted to be liked and accepted by the other kids at school

In the seventh grade I started using LSD and smoking pot

MANY youths today including some reared by Christian parents lead double lives

Not that all become drug users as did Robert
Ɛnyɛ wɔn nyinaa na wɔde nnuru di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so sɛnea Robert yɛe no
But behind the backs of their parents some youths do secretly date drink wear outlandish clothing listen to wild music attend rowdy parties and engage in a host of other activities that are frowned upon or forbidden by their parents

If so you probably know that what you are doing is wrong

Like Robert you may even suffer the pangs of a guilty conscience

Still the thought of revealing your misdeeds to your parents is not a pleasant one
Nanso ebia ɛyɛ wo den sɛ wobɛka wo nneyɛe bɔne no ho asɛm akyerɛ w’awofo

Faulty Reasoning	Nsusuwii a Ɛnteɛ
You might feel for example that you have some legitimate gripes about the way your parents do things
Sɛ nhwɛso no ebia wobɛte nka sɛ w’awofo yɛ nneɛma bi a enye
Perhaps you do
Ebia ɛte saa
But even if they are at times unreasonably strict uncommunicative or arbitrary does that justify continued disobedience ?	Nanso sɛ w’awofo ayɛ wo so katee a ntease nnim wɔne wo nni nkitaho anaasɛ wɔyɛ nhyɛso mpo a so ɛno kyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ asoɔden ?
Not according to God s Word which counsels Be obedient to your parents in everything for this is well pleasing in the Lord
Onyankopɔn Asɛm nkyerɛ saa etu fo sɛ Muntie mo awofo asɛm ade nyinaa ho na eyi na ɛsɔ Awurade ani
And what if you feel you are legitimately angry with your parents ?	Na sɛ wote nka sɛ wowɔ ntease pa a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wo bo fuw w’awofo nso ɛ ?
Does it make sense to vent that anger by secretly violating God given standards ?	So nyansa wom sɛ wubewia wo ho abu Onyankopɔn gyinapɛn ahorow a ɔde ama so de ada w’abufuw adi ?
In effect you would then be acting as if you were enraged against Jehovah himself
Sɛ saa a ɛnde na woreyɛ ade ma ayɛ sɛ nea wo koma huru hyɛ Yehowa
The right thing to do would be to approach your parents and calmly discuss with them any grievances you have
Proverbs
Nea ɛfata sɛ woyɛ ne sɛ wobɛkɔ w’awofo nkyɛn na wo ne wɔn aka nea ɛhaw wo ho asɛm bɔkɔɔ

Equally faulty is the belief that by maintaining silence you protect your parents from emotional upset
Ɛnteɛ nso sɛ wubesusuw sɛ komm a wobɛyɛ a worenkasa no bɛbɔ w’awofo ho ban na wɔanni yaw
One year old boy said I wouldn t talk about something that disappoints my parents
Abarimaa bi a wadi mfe kae sɛ Na menka biribi a ɛbɛma m’awofo ahaw nkyerɛ wɔn
Again such slick reasoning is nothing more than self deception
Ɛha nso nsusuwii a ɛnteɛ a ɛte saa no yɛ nnaadaa
As the Bible puts it it is a case of someone acting too smoothly to himself in his own eyes to find out his error so as to hate it
Sɛnea Bible ka no ɛyɛ ade a obi yɛ de bu ne ho na wanhu n’amumɔyɛ na wakyi
’
When you really care about your parents feelings you avoid disobedience in the first place
Sɛ wudwen w’awofo nkate ho ankasa a nea edi kan koraa no wobɛkwati asoɔdenyɛ
Besides any attempts to keep them in the dark will probably prove vain for doubtless others already know about your secret life
Nea ɛka ho bio no ebia mmɔden biara a wobɛbɔ sɛ wode nneɛma besie w’awofo no renyɛ yiye efisɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ afoforo pii nim nea woyɛ no sum ase no ho nsɛm dedaw
Nothing Is Hidden	Biribiara Nni Hɔ a Ahintaw
The ancient Israelites found this out when they tried to get away with secret wrongdoing
Tete Israelfo huu eyi bere a wɔbɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkwati wɔn bɔne ho asotwe no
Warned the prophet Isaiah Woe to those who are going very deep in concealing counsel from Jehovah himself and whose deeds have occurred in a dark place while they say Who is seeing us and who is knowing of us ? 	Odiyifo Yesaia bɔɔ wɔn kɔkɔ sɛ Wonnue wɔn a wɔde agyinatu hintaw Yehowa fee na wɔn nneyɛe wɔ esum mu na wɔka sɛ Hena na ohu yɛn anaa hena na onim yɛn ? 
The Israelites forgot that God saw their deeds of misconduct
Israelfo no werɛ fii sɛ Onyankopɔn huu wɔn nneyɛe bɔne no
In due time he called them to account for their errors
Wɔ bere a ɛsɛ mu no ɔma wonyaa wɔn bɔne ho asotwe
The same proved true for some Christians in the first century congregation
Ɛbae saa wɔ Kristofo bi a na wɔwɔ afeha a edi kan asafo no mu fam
Read for yourself at Acts the account about Ananias and his wife Sapphira
W’ankasa kenkan Anania ne ne yere Safira ho asɛm wɔ Asomafo no Nnwuma
When a special fund was set up to care for needy Christians Ananias sold a field and boldly claimed he was contributing the entire proceeds of its sale
Bere a woyii tow soronko bi de boaa Kristofo a na ahia wɔn no Anania kɔtɔn asase bi na ɔde akokoduru kae sɛ sika no nyinaa na ɔde bae
In reality though Ananias had secretly held back some of the price for his personal gain
Nanso nokwarem no na Anania ayi eti ade no bi de asie ’ ama ɔno ankasa yiyeyɛ
Was God fooled by this pretense of generosity ?	So wɔnam atoro ayamye yi so tumi daadaa Onyankopɔn ?
Not at all
Dabida
You have played false not to men but to God said the apostle Peter
Ɔsomafo Petro kae sɛ Ɛnyɛ nnipa na woadi atoro akyerɛ wɔn na ɛyɛ Onyankopɔn
On hearing these words Ananias fell down and expired
Na Anania tee nsɛm yi no ɔhwee ase wui
Sapphira who was an accomplice was struck down shortly thereafter
Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi no Safira a na ɔyɛ ne bɔne no boafo no nso hwee fam wui
Both apparently forgot that God is aware of the secrets of the heart
Psalm
Wɔn baanu nyinaa werɛ fii sɛ Onyankopɔn nim komam ahintasɛm

Likewise today even if you are successfully hiding misconduct from your parents you cannot hide such misconduct from the watchful eyes of Jehovah God
Ɛte saa ara nnɛ sɛ wutumi de wo nneyɛe bɔne sie w’awofo koraa a wuntumi mfa nsie Yehowa Nyankopɔn a n’ani hu ade nyinaa no
There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight says Hebrews but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting
Hebrifo ka sɛ Enni abɔde biara a ɛnna adi n’anim na ade nyinaa ho da hɔ na ɛso abue nea yɛne no wɔ asɛm no anim
Could you possibly feel more exposed than that ?	So ebetumi aba sɛ wo nso wo ho betumi ada hɔ asen saa ?
And in time your hidden sins will be revealed to others as well
Bere a bere kɔ so no wo nneyɛe bɔne no bɛda adi ma afoforo ahu
Says Proverbs Even by his practices a boy makes himself recognized as to whether his activity is pure and upright
Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Abofra po wɔde ne nneyɛe na ehu no sɛ n’adeyɛ bɛyɛ yiye na ateɛ
Another proverb says He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed

Do not delude yourself into thinking you can appease God simply by putting on a show of devotion when you attend religious meetings

Philippine Supreme Court Upholds Freedom of Worship	Philippines Asennibea Kunini Gye Ɔsom Mu Ahofadi Tom

ON JUNE as millions of Filipino schoolchildren trooped back to their classrooms Jehovah s Witnesses among them were most happy
BERE a Philippines sukuu mmofra mpempem pii san kɔɔ sukuu wɔ June no na Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ wɔn mu no ne mmofra a wɔwɔ anigye kɛse
Why ?	Dɛn ntia ?
Because on March just before the closing of the preceding school year the Supreme Court of the Philippines reversed a Supreme Court decision of and upheld the right of children of Jehovah s Witnesses to refrain from saluting the flag reciting the pledge of allegiance and singing the national anthem
Efisɛ wɔ March no aka bere tiaa bi ma wɔde sukuu afe a na ɛretwam no aba awiei no Philippines Asennibea Kunini no san danee gyinae a esii wɔ mu no na wɔagye hokwan a Yehowa Adansefo mmofra wɔ sɛ wɔtwe wɔn ho fi frankaakyia ntam a wɔka ne ɔman dwom to ho no atom

And what consequences are there for all lovers of freedom in the Philippines as a result of this decision ?	Na dɛn na saa gyinaesi yi kyerɛ ma wɔn a wɔdɔ ahofadi a wɔwɔ Philippines nyinaa ?
Why Jehovah s Witnesses Do Not Salute the Flag	Nea Enti a Yehowa Adansefo Nkyia Frankaa
Jehovah s Witnesses believe that saluting a flag singing a national anthem and reciting a pledge of allegiance are religious acts
Yehowa Adansefo gye di sɛ frankaa a wokyia ɔman dwom a wɔto ne ntam a wɔka yɛ ɔsom mu nneyɛe
Their Bible trained conscience does not permit them to participate in such acts of worship
Wɔn ahonim a wɔde Bible atete no mma wɔn kwan mma wɔmfa wɔn ho nhyɛ ɔsom mu nneyɛe a ɛtete saa mu
No matter what country they live in this is their stand in imitation of Jesus Christ who said that his followers would be no part of the world just as he was no part of the world
John
Ɛmfa ho ɔman ko a wɔte mu no eyi ne afa a wogyina de suasua Yesu Kristo a ɔkae sɛ n’akyidifo mfi wiase sɛnea na ɔno nso mfi wiase no
’ Yohane
At the same time Jehovah s Witnesses show respect for the governments they live under and they believe that these are an arrangement that God permits
Bere koro no ara mu no Yehowa Adansefo kyerɛ obu ma aban ahorow a wɔhyɛ wɔn ase no na wogye di sɛ ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a Onyankopɔn ma ho kwan
Thus they are under obligation to obey the laws of the land pay taxes and give due honor to the governing officials
Enti ɛyɛ wɔn asɛyɛde sɛ wodi ɔman no mmara horow so tua tow ahorow na wɔde nidi a ɛfata ma aban mpanyimfo

Reasons for Supreme Court Decision	Nea Enti a Asennibea Kunini No Sii Gyinae No
What reasons were given by the present Supreme Court for reversing the decision of the Gerona v
Dɛn nti na Asennibea Kunini yi danee gyinae a wosii wɔ Gerona ne nhomasua soafo ntam asɛm mu no
Secretary of Education decision ? The decision written by Justice Grino Aquino stated The idea that one may be compelled to salute the flag sing the national anthem and recite the patriotic pledge during a flag ceremony on pain of being dismissed from one s job or of being expelled from school is alien to the conscience of the present generation of Filipinos who cut their teeth on the Bill of Rights which guarantees their rights to free speech and the free exercise of religious profession and worship
Gyinae a wosii wɔ a Ɔtemmufo Grino Aquino kyerɛwee no ne sɛ Twe a wɔbɛtwe obi aso esiane sɛ wankyia frankaa anto ɔman dwom anka ɔman dɔ ho ntam wɔ frankaakyia afahyɛ ase denam yi a wobeyi onii adi afi adwuma anaa sukuu mu no yɛ ade foforo koraa ma Philippinefo awo ntoatoaso a wɔwɔ hɔ mprempren a wɔde Ahofadi ho Mmara a ɛma wonya ɔkasa ɔsom adwumayɛ ne ɔsom mu ahofadi tetee wɔn fi wɔn mmofraase pɛɛ no ahonim
It was observed by the Court that while Jehovah s Witnesses do not take part in the compulsory flag ceremony they do not engage in external acts or behavior that would offend their countrymen who believe in expressing their love of country through the observance of the flag ceremony
Asennibea no hui sɛ bere a Yehowa Adansefo nkyia frankaa no wɔnyɛ nneɛma ahorow bi a ɛtwetwe amanfo adwene ’ ba wɔn so anaa adeyɛ bi a ɛbɛhyɛ wɔn manfo a wogye di sɛ frankaa a wokyia no so na wɔnam da wɔn man ho dɔ adi no abufuw nso
The Court further observed They quietly stand at attention during the flag ceremony to show their respect for the right of those who choose to participate in the solemn proceedings
Asennibea no hui nso sɛ Wogyina hɔ dinn de kyerɛ obu ma wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ nea ɛkɔ so no mu no
Since they do not engage in disruptive behavior there is no warrant for their expulsion
Esiane sɛ wɔnyɛ basabasa biara nti ɛho nhia sɛ woyi wɔn adi
The present Court also came to grips with the prediction made in the Gerona decision that if Jehovah s Witnesses are allowed to be exempt from the flag salute requirement the flag ceremony will become a thing of the past or perhaps conducted with very few participants and the time will come when we would have citizens untaught and uninculcated in and not imbued with reverence for the flag and love of country admiration for national heroes and patriotism a pathetic even tragic situation and all because a small portion of the school population imposed its will demanded and was granted an exemption
Asennibea a ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren no san nso dii asɛm bi a wɔka too hɔ sɛ ɛbɛba wɔ Gerona asɛm no ho gyinaesi no mu na ɛne sɛ sɛ wɔma Yehowa Adansefo yi wɔn ho fi frankaakyia mu a frankaakyia ho guasodeyɛ no bɛyɛ biribi a ebetwam bere bi anaasɛ ebia nnipa kakraa bi na wɔde wɔn ho behyem na ebedu mmere bi no yebenya amanfo a wonnim ɛho hwee na wɔmfaa ɛho adwene nnuaa wɔn mu na wonni nidi a ɛfata ma frankaa no ne ɔdɔ ma ɔman no wonnya wɔn man akatakyie ho anigye ne wɔn man ho dɔ asɛm a ɛbɛyɛ awerɛhow tebea a ɛbɛyɛ asiane mpo a nea ɛde eyi nyinaa bɛba ne sɛ wɔmaa sukuufo kakraa bi kwan maa wɔyɛɛ nea wɔpɛ na wɔpenee so maa woyii wɔn ho fii adeyɛ no mu nti
The Court decision answered this by stating The situation that the Court direly predicted in Gerona
has not come to pass
Asennibea no gyinae a esii wɔ mu no de eyi ho anoyi mae bere a ɛkae sɛ Tebea a Asennibea no ka too hɔ sɛ ɛyɛ hu wɔ Gerona asɛm no mu no
mmaa mu
We are not persuaded that by exempting the Jehovah s Witnesses from saluting the flag singing the national anthem and reciting the patriotic pledge this religious group which admittedly comprises a small portion of the school population will shake up our part of the globe and suddenly produce a nation untaught and uninculcated in and unimbued with reverence for the flag patriotism love of country and admiration for national heroes
Yenhui sɛ yi a yeyii Yehowa Adansefo fii frankaakyia ɔman dwom to ne ɔman ho dɔ ntanka mu no saa nyamesom kuw a yegye tom sɛ wɔn mu kakraa bi na wɔka yɛn sukuu mmofra ’ ho no de basabasayɛ aba yɛn man yi mu ma ɛde ɔman a wonnim hwee na wɔmfaa hwee nnuaa wɔn mu a wɔmfa nidi a ɛfata mma frankaa na wonni ɔman ho dɔ na wonni wɔn man akatakyie ho anigye aba
’ 
Finally the present Court referred to the comments of Mr
Justice Robert Jackson of the U
S
Supreme Court in the Barnette case in which he stated To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds
Awiei koraa no Asennibea a ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren no twee adwene kɔɔ asɛm a Owura Justice Robert Jackson a ɔwɔ United States Asennibea Kunini no kae wɔ mu wɔ Barnette asenni mu no so nea ɛse Susuw a yebesusuw sɛ ɔman ho dɔ rennya nkɔso esiane sɛ yɛma kwan ma amanfo fi wɔn pɛ mu de wɔn ho hyɛ ɔman ho dɔ ho afahyɛ ahorow mu mmom sen sɛ yɛbɛhyɛ wɔn ma wɔayɛ saa no yɛ adwene a ɛnteɛ na ɛremma nnipa a wofi wɔn pɛ mu yɛ ade ani nnye yɛn amanne ho
Freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much
Ahofadi a obi wɔ sɛ ɔde n’ankasa adwene di dwuma no mfa nneɛma a ɛho nhia kɛse nkutoo ho
That would be a mere shadow of freedom
Anka ɛno bɛyɛ ahofadi a ɛtɔ sin
The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order
Nea ɛma wohu ahofadi ankasa ne hokwan a ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ afoforo nya su a ɛsonsonoe wɔ nneɛma a amanfo ani gye ho no ho
After these fine points of law were made the unanimous decision of the Philippine Court was The expulsion orders issued by the public respondents against the petitioners are hereby ANNULLED AND SET ASIDE
Bere a wɔkaa mmara ho nsɛm atitiriw a ɛfata yi akyi no Philippines Asennibea no sii gyinae a atemmufo no nyinaa penee so sɛ WƆATWA mmara horow a wɔde yi adi a wɔhyɛ tiaa wɔn a wɔde wɔn asɛm bɛdan asennibea yi no mu NA WƆDE ATO NKYƐN
The temporary restraining order against the school authorities which was issued by this Court is hereby made permanent
Bere tiaa mu mmara bi a wɔde siw sukuu mpanyimfo kwan a Asennibea yi de mae no abɛyɛ nea ɛtra hɔ daa
Associate Justice Isagani Cruz in a concurring opinion added this observation In my humble view Gerona was based on an erroneous assumption
Bere a ɔyɔnko temmufo Justice Isagani Cruz reka biribi de afoa gyinae a wɔasi no so no ɔde eyi kaa ho sɛ Sɛnea mihu asɛm no na Gerona asɛm no ho gyinaesi no gyina nsusuwii a ɛnteɛ so
The Court that promulgated it was apparently laboring under the conviction that the State had the right to determine what was religious and what was not and to dictate to the individual what he could and could not worship
Ɛda adi sɛ na asennibea a esii saa gyinae no susuw sɛ ɔman no wɔ hokwan sɛ ɛkyerɛ nea ɛyɛ ɔsom mu adeyɛ ne nea ɛnyɛ saa na wɔkyerɛ nea ankorankoro bi betumi asom ne nea ontumi nsom
In requiring the herein petitioners to participate in the flag ceremony the State has declared ex cathedra that they are not violating the Bible by saluting the flag
Bere a na ɛrehwehwɛ ma wɔn a wɔredi wɔn asɛm yi de wɔn ho ahyɛ frankaakyia no mu no nea na ɛkyerɛ ne sɛ ɔman no fi ne tumi mu reka sɛ frankaa a wɔbɛkyia no nto Bible mmara
This is to me an unwarranted intrusion into their religious beliefs which tell them the opposite
Wɔ me fam no eyi yɛ yɛn ho a yɛde gyigye wɔn som mu gyidi a ɛne nea yɛka bɔ abira mu wɔ ɔkwan a ɛmfata so
The State cannot interpret the Bible for them
Ɔman no ntumi nkyerɛkyerɛ Bible no mu mma wɔn
It has no competence in this matter
Ɔman no nni eyi ho nimdeɛ
The Meaning for Lovers of Freedom	Nea Ɛkyerɛ ma Wɔn a Wɔdɔ Ahofadi
All lovers of freedom certainly rejoice in this decision to uphold the right of free choice in the matter of religion and in the dictates of one s conscience while at the same time being subject to the relative authority of the state
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔn a wɔdɔ ahofadi nyinaa ani gye saa gyinae a wosi de penee hokwan a obiara wɔ sɛ ɔpaw ɔsom ko a ɔpɛ ne nea n’ahonim kyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ a bere koro no ara ɔde ne ho hyɛ ɔman no tumidi ase no ho
In protecting the rights of individuals the State does not open the way for anarchy but rather serves in the role mentioned by the apostle Paul at Romans where he states There is
compelling reason for you people to be in subjection
on account of your conscience
Ankorankoro hokwan a wɔwɔ ho ban a ɔman no bɔ no mma basabasayɛ mma na mmom edi dwuma a ɔsomafo Paulo bɔɔ din wɔ Romafo no beae a ɛka sɛ Etwa sɛ mobrɛ mo ho ase hyɛ wɔn ase

For that is why you are also paying taxes for they are God s public servants constantly serving this very purpose
Eyi nti nso na muyi tow efisɛ wɔyɛ Onyankopɔn asomfo a wokura ɔsom yi mu ara
Jehovah s Witnesses in the Philippines respect the jurisprudence of the justices of the Supreme Court and realize that final credit must be given to our Creator Jehovah God

Ɛwom sɛ wɔtetee no wɔ Katolek asɔre mu de nanso na ɛnkyɛe na n’adamfo bi a ɔnyɛ Katolekni ne no fii Bible adesua ase denneennen
She could see that the Bible described baptism as something different from the rite she had received in infancy
Na otumi hu sɛ sɛnea Bible ka asubɔ ho asɛm no yɛ soronko wɔ amanne a wɔyɛɛ no wɔ ne mmofraberem no ho
Does this mean I will have to get baptized again ? she asked sincerely

 I m afraid that doing so would offend God
Misuro sɛ saa a mɛyɛ no bɛma Onyankopɔn bo afuw
Hundreds of millions of persons both Catholics and Protestants have had water sprinkled or poured on them as infants in a baptism ceremony
Wɔde nsu petepetee nnipa ɔpepehaha pii a wɔyɛ Katolekfo ne Protestantfo nyinaa so anaa wohwie guu wɔn so wɔ wɔn mmofraberem de yɛɛ asubɔ ho amanne
Millions of other persons were baptized by some form of complete immersion in water when they were older
Wɔnam nsu mu a wɔde afoforo ɔpepem pii hyɛe bere a na wɔanyinyin kakra no so bɔɔ wɔn asu
This raises the question Just what is Christian baptism ?	Eyi ma asemmisa yi sɔre sɛ Dɛn ankasa ne Kristofo asubɔ ?
Are there any circumstances that would warrant a second baptism ?	So tebea horow bi betumi ama abehia sɛ wɔbɔ obi asu bio ?
The Pocket Catholic Dictionary defines baptism as the sacrament in which by water and the word of God a person is cleansed of all sin and reborn and sanctified in Christ to everlasting life
Pocket Catholic Dictionary kyerɛ asubɔ ase sɛ adommenade a wɔnam nsu ne Onyankopɔn asɛm so tew obi ho fi bɔne nyinaa ho na wɔwo no foforo dwira no ho wɔ Kristo mu kɔ asetra a enni awiei mu
Regarding rebaptism this same source says that baptism imprints an indelible mark on the soul which means that it cannot because it need not be repeated
Saa nhoma no ara ka asu a wɔbɔ obi bio ho asɛm sɛ asubɔ ma ɔkra no agyiraehyɛde bi a wontumi mpopa na ɛkyerɛ sɛ obi ntumi mmɔ asu bio efisɛ ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa

Make Disciples Baptizing Them	Monyɛ Asuafo na Mommɔ Wɔn Asu
At Matthew we read the command regarding baptism that the risen Christ gave to his disciples before he ascended to heaven
Yɛkenkan ahyɛde a ɛfa asubɔ ho a Kristo a wɔanyan no de maa n’asuafo ansa na ɔrekɔ soro no ho asɛm wɔ Mateo
Go therefore make disciples of all the nations baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and teach them to observe all the commands I gave you
Enti monkɔ monyɛ amanaman no nyinaa asuafo mommɔ wɔn asu nhyɛ Agya ne Ɔba ne Honhom Kronkron din mu na monkyerɛkyerɛ wɔn sɛ wonni ahyɛde ahorow a mede ama mo no nyinaa so
The Jerusalem Bible Clearly baptism is required of Christian disciples those who have been taught to observe Christ s commands not infants
The Jerusalem Bible Ɛda adi pefee sɛ wɔn a wɔhwehwɛ sɛ wɔbɔ wɔn asu ne Kristofo asuafo wɔn a wɔakyerɛkyerɛ wɔn sɛ wonni Kristo ahyɛde ahorow so no na ɛnyɛ nkokoa
This harmonizes with the fact that all the baptisms described in the Scriptures involved disciples who evidently were completely immersed in water
Eyi ne nokwasɛm a ɛne sɛ wɔn a Kyerɛwnsɛm no kaa wɔn asubɔ ho asɛm nyinaa yɛ asuafo a adanse a ɛwɔ hɔ kyerɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn hyɛɛ nsu mu korakora no hyia
This was obviously the case when Christ Jesus himself was baptized by John the Baptizer
Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ne ɔkwan a Yohane Osuboni faa so bɔɔ Kristo Yesu ankasa asu
The Bible account says that upon being baptized Jesus came up from the water of the Jordan River
Bible kyerɛwtohɔ no ka sɛ wɔbɔɔ Yesu asu wiee no ofii adi fii nsu no a ɛne Yordan Asubɔnten no mu
Indeed the Scriptures indicate that John chose his baptismal sites carefully in order to have plenty of water available
John
Nokwarem no Kyerɛwnsɛm no da no adi sɛ Yohane de ahwɛyiye paw mmeae a ɔbɔɔ nkurɔfo asu no sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obenya nsu pii wɔ hɔ

Later in describing the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch the Bible tells us that Philip went down into the water with the eunuch and baptized him after which they came out of the water
Akyiri yi bere a Bible no reka Etiopiani piani no asubɔ ho asɛm no ɛka kyerɛ yɛn sɛ Filipo ne piani no sian kɔɔ nsu no mu na ɔbɔɔ no asu na ɛno akyi no wofii adi fii nsu no mu
These baptisms by immersion are in keeping with the general meaning of the Greek word ba pti zo to baptize from ba pto meaning to dip in or under which is the root of the English word baptism
Saa asubɔ ahorow a wɔde nnipa no hyɛɛ nsu mu no ne ntease a Hela asɛmfua a wonyaa Engiresi asɛmfua baptism fii mu a ɛne ba pti zo sɛ wɔbɛbɔ asu a efi ba pto a n’asekyerɛ ne sɛ wɔde bɛhyem anaa wɔde bɛhyɛ ase mu no hyia

Would it ever be appropriate to baptize them again ?	So ebetumi ayɛ nea ɛfata sɛ wɔbɔ wɔn asu bio ?
An incident related in Acts helps us to answer these questions

It was likely during the winter of C
E
that the apostle Paul visited the wealthy city of Ephesus in Asia Minor
Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ afe anaa Y
B

There he found some disciples who needed to be rebaptized
Ɛhɔ na ohuu asuafo bi a na ehia sɛ wɔbɔ wɔn asu bio
After learning that these men had been baptized with John s baptism Paul rebaptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus
Bere a Paulo hui sɛ Yohane asubɔ na wɔde bɔɔ saa mmarima yi asu no ɔbɔɔ wɔn asu bio hyɛɛ Awurade Yesu din mu
He did not feel that doing so would offend God
Wante nka sɛ saa a ɔbɛyɛ no bɛhyɛ Onyankopɔn abufuw
Clearly God agreed with Paul s reasoning and far from taking offense at this rebaptism God validated it with the gift of holy spirit
Ɛda adi pefee sɛ Onyankopɔn penee Paulo adwene no so na sɛ anka Onyankopɔn bo befuw sɛ wɔabɔ wɔn asu bio no ɔde honhom kronkron akyɛde no kyerɛe sɛ ɔpene so
Had the men rejected Paul s teaching regarding the nature of baptism and the importance of the Messiah Christ Jesus no doubt Paul would have withheld baptism
Sɛ mmarima no pow Paulo nkyerɛkyerɛ a ɛfa sɛnea asubɔ te ne sɛnea Mesia Kristo Yesu ho hia ho no a akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka Paulo remmɔ wɔn asu
First the men had to qualify for baptism

How to Qualify for Baptism	Nea Ɛbɛyɛ na Obi Afata Asubɔ

How did they qualify ?	Ɔkwan bɛn na wɔnam so fatae ?
First as Jews and Jewish proselytes they began with a good background knowledge of Jehovah God his dealings with his people and Bible prophecies about his promised Messiah
Nea edi kan no sɛ Yudafo ne wɔn a wɔadan Yudafo no na wɔwɔ Yehowa Nyankopɔn ɔkwan a ɔfa so ne nnipa di ne Bible nkɔmhyɛ ahorow a ɛfa ne Mesia a wahyɛ ne ho bɔ ho no ho nimdeɛ pii dedaw
Second they took in further accurate knowledge during an inspired witness given by the apostle Peter that day
Afei nso bere a ɔsomafo Petro nam honhom so dii adanse saa da no wonyaa nokware nimdeɛ foforo
With what result ?	Dɛn na efii mu bae ?
 Hearing this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the apostles What must we do brothers ? 	 Wɔtee eyi no ɛwowɔɔ wɔn komam na wɔka kyerɛɛ Petro ne asomafo a aka no sɛ Anuanom yɛnyɛ dɛn ? ’
 You must repent Peter answered and every one of you must be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
Petro buae sɛ Monsakra mo adwene na mo mu biara mma wɔmmɔ no asu Yesu Kristo din mu mma mo bɔne fafiri na mubenya Honhom Kronkron akyɛde no
’ 
Note that Peter s witness was not superficial
Hyɛ no nsow sɛ na Petro adansedi no nyɛ aniani
He spoke to them for a long time using many arguments
Ɔde tidan nsɛm pii ne wɔn kasae bere tenten
They were convinced by his reasoning and they accepted what he said and were baptized
Wɔne no bɛyɛɛ adwene wɔ nea ɔne wɔn susuw ho no ho na wogyee nea ɔkae no toom ma wɔbɔɔ wɔn asu
That very day about three thousand were added to their number
Acts JB
Saa da no ara wɔde nnipa bɛyɛ mpensa bɛkaa wɔn ho

The same elements are required for Scripturally valid baptisms today accurate knowledge sincere repentance and conversion or turning to God and away from this perverse generation
Wɔhwehwɛ nneɛma koro yi ara wɔ asubɔ ho nnɛ na ama ɛne Kyerɛwnsɛm no ahyia nokware nimdeɛ ahonu a efi komam ne adwensakra anaa bata a obi bɛbata Onyankopɔn ho na watwe ne ho afi awo ntoatoaso kɔntɔnkye yi ho
Moreover Scripturally valid baptisms must be in the name of Jesus Christ that is based on an acceptance of his ransom sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins and submitting to him as God s enthroned king
Acts JB Romans
Afei nso ɛsɛ sɛ asubɔ a ɛne Kyerɛwnsɛm no hyia yɛ nea wɔbɔ no Yesu Kristo din mu kyerɛ sɛ nea egyina n’agyede afɔrebɔ no a obi begye atom sɛ ɛno na ɛde bɔne fafiri ba ne brɛ a ɔbɛbrɛ ne ho ase ama no sɛ onii a Onyankopɔn de no asi hene so
Asomafo no Nnwuma JB Romafo
Sincere people who are Scripturally qualified for baptism need not fear that by getting rebaptized they will displease God
Ɛnsɛ sɛ nnipa komapafo a wɔnam Kyerɛwnsɛm no so fata ma asubɔ no suro sɛ sɛ wɔbɔ wɔn asu bio a ɛbɛhyɛ Onyankopɔn abufuw
To the contrary the Scripturally proper baptism of qualified people brings joy to God
Nea ɛne no bɔ abira no asubɔ a ɛne Kyerɛwnsɛm no hyia a nnipa a wɔfata gye no ma Onyankopɔn ani gye

Ɔhene Richard III na ɔkaa nsɛm a agye din yi wɔ Shakespeare ɔyɛkyerɛ a wɔato din sɛnea ɛwɔ atifi hɔ yi ara mu na ɛka ahonu a onipa ahonim betumi ama wanya ho asɛm
In real life the conscience has unsettled and altered the lives of many
Ahonim tumi haw nkurɔfo na ɛsakra nnipa pii asetra ankasa
The power of the conscience was illustrated by the recent case of a young Italian
Italiani aberante bi asɛm a esii nnansa yi kyerɛkyerɛɛ tumi a ahonim wɔ no mu
His work as a security guard involved transporting large sums of money
N’adwuma a na ɔyɛ sɛ ɔwɛmfo no nti na ɔde sika kɛse tutu akwan
All went well until one day he gave in to temptation and stole a sack containing lire
Nneɛma kɔɔ yiye ara de kosii sɛ da koro bi ogyaee ne ho mu na owiaa kotoku bi a sika lire wom
Since he was working with two colleagues and it was impossible to determine which one of them had taken it all three were fired
Esiane sɛ na ɔne ne mfɛfo baanu na ɛyɛ adwuma na wontumi nkyerɛ wɔn mu nea wafa no nti woyii wɔn baasa nyinaa adi fii adwuma mu
He hid the stolen money intending to use it after the storm had calmed
Ɔde sika a owiae no siei a na ɔwɔ adwene sɛ sɛ asɛm no to twa a wadi
Instead an unexpected torment began He couldn t stop thinking about the firing of his innocent workmates
Sɛ anka ɛbɛba saa no ateetee bi a na ɔnhwɛ kwan fii ase Wantumi annyae ne mfɛfo adwumayɛfo a wɔn ho nni asɛm a na wɔayi wɔn adi no ho adwennwen
His conscience would not give him a moment s peace
N’ahonim amma ne ho antɔ no da
He couldn t sleep
Na ontumi nna
He couldn t eat
Ontumi nnidi
He became impossible to deal with
Na obiara ntumi ne no nni nkitaho
Finally overcome by guilt and exhausted by his internal struggle he went to the police and handed over the stolen money
Awiei koraa no bere a afobu ne adwennwen ama no ahaw yiye no ɔde sika a owiae no kɔmaa polisifo
He told them The remorse was too much
Ɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn sɛ Manu me ho dodo
I can t put up with it any longer ! 	Mintumi nnyina ano bio ! 
He added Better in jail and honest than free with a conscience that condemns you as a thief
Ɔde kaa ho sɛ Ɛyɛ sɛ medi nokware na mada afiase sen sɛ mɛfa me ho adi na m’ahonim abu me fɔ sɛ owifo
The conscience is God s gift to all men
Ahonim no yɛ Onyankopɔn akyɛde a nnipa nyinaa wɔ bi
It may accuse or excuse us
Ebetumi anunu yɛn anaa ama yɛayi yɛn ho ano
When we listen to it it may save us from making mistakes rationalizing away serious wrongdoing
Sɛ yetie no a ɛbɛbɔ yɛn ho ban afi mfomso ahorow a yɛbɛyɛ ho na ama yɛakwati sɛ yɛbɛbrɛ bɔne a anibere wom ase
So instead of ignoring its proddings or resentfully railing against it as Shakespeare s King Richard III did we should cherish and safeguard our conscience
Romans
Enti sɛ anka yɛbɛpow ne kɔkɔbɔ anaasɛ yɛde adwemmɔne bɛko atia te sɛ nea Ɔhene Richard III a Shakespeare kaa ne ho asɛm no yɛe no ɛsɛ sɛ yɛkyerɛ yɛn ahonim ho anigye na yɛbɔ ho ban

Husbands and Wives Do They Really Talk Differently ?	Okununom ne Ɔyerenom So Ɛyɛ Ampa sɛ Ɛsono Sɛnea Wɔkasa ?
JUST suppose that Bill shuffled into Jerry s office his shoulders visibly sagging under the weight of his worries
WO DE fa no sɛ Kwame tutu anammɔn kɔ Yaw office na n’anim kyerɛ sɛ nsɛm pii haw no
Jerry looked gently at his friend and waited for him to speak
Yaw hwɛɛ n’adamfo no komm na ɔtwɛnee sɛ ɔbɛkasa
I don t know if I can close this deal sighed Bill
Kwame guu ahome kae sɛ Minnye nni sɛ metumi awie adwuma yi
There are so many snags and the head office is really pressuring me
Ɔhaw ahorow pii a na menhwɛ kwan abam na mpanyimfo no nso gyina me so denneennen
What are you worried about Bill ? 	Yaw de akokoduru bisae sɛ Kwame dɛn na ɛhaw wo ?
Jerry asked confidently
You know you re the best man for the job and they know it too
Wunim sɛ wone onipa a ɔfata ma adwuma no na adwumam mpanyimfo no nyinaa nso nim saa
Just take your time
Wo de tɔ wo bo ase
You think this is bad ?	So wususuw sɛ eyi yɛ asɛnkɛse ?
Why just last month
Wunim ɔsram a etwaam yi ara
Jerry recounted the humorous details of his own little fiasco and soon his friend left the office laughing and relieved
Yaw kaa n’ankasa ne mfomso ketewa bi a ɔyɛe a na ɛyɛ serew ho asɛm na ankyɛ na n’adamfo no de serew fii ne office hɔ kɔe a na ne ho asan no
Jerry was happy to help
Yaw ani gyei sɛ otumi boaa no
And also suppose that when he arrived home that afternoon Jerry could tell right away that his wife Pam was also upset
Na afei fa no sɛ bere a Yaw kɔɔ fie awia no otumi hui ntɛm ara sɛ ne yere Adwoa nso ahaw
He greeted her with particular cheeriness and then waited for her to say what was on her mind
Ɔde anigye soronko bi kyiaa no na afei ɔtwɛnee sɛ ɔbɛka dekode a ɛhaw no akyerɛ no
After a tense stony silence she blurted out I can t take it anymore !	Bere a ɔyɛɛ komm a na ɔnkeka ne ho akyi no ɔde abufuw teɛɛm sɛ Mintumi nnyina ano bio !
This new boss is a tyrant ! 	Saa adwumam panyin foforo yi hyɛ nnipa so dodo ! 
Jerry sat her down put his arm around her and said Honey don t be so upset
Yaw de no traa ase de ne nsa too ne kɔn mu kae sɛ Ɔdɔ mma ɛnnhaw wo
Look it s only a job
Tie ɛyɛ adwuma asɛm
Bosses are like that
Saa ara na adwumam mpanyimfo te
You should have heard the way mine ranted on today
Sɛ wowɔ hɔ a anka wubehu sɛnea m’adwumam panyin kasaa abufuw so bere tenteenten nnɛ
If it s too much for you though just quit
Nanso sɛ wote nka sɛ ɛboro so dodo a gyae adwuma no
You don t even care how I feel ! Pam shot back
Adwoa kaa no ntɛm ara sɛ Wunnwen sɛnea mete nka ho mpo !
 You never listen to me !	Wuntie nea meka da !
I can t quit !	Mintumi nnyae adwuma no !
You don t bring home enough money ! 	W’akatua nso yɛn ! 
She ran off to the bedroom to have a good cry
Ɔde mmirika kɔhyɛɛ dan mu suu pii
Jerry stood outside the closed door in shock wondering what had happened
Yaw de ahodwiriw gyinaa ɔpon no akyi a na onhu nea asi
Why were there such opposite reactions to Jerry s words of comfort ?	Dɛn na ɛmaa Kwame ne Adwoa yɛɛ wɔn ade wɔ akwana ɛbɔ abira koraa so wɔ Yaw awerɛkyekye nsɛm no ho saa ?
A Gender Gap ?	So Efi Nsonsonoe a Ɛwɔ Mmarima ne Mmea Ntam No ?
Some would attribute the difference in these illustrations to one simple fact Bill is a man Pam is a woman
Ebinom de nsonsonoe a ɛwɔ mfatoho ahorow yi mu no bɛhyɛ ade biako pɛ Kwame yɛ ɔbarima Adwoa yɛ ɔbea
Linguistic researchers believe that communication difficulties in marriage are often because of gender
Kasa ho nhwehwɛmufo gye di sɛ mpɛn pii no nsonsonoe a ɛwɔ ɔbarima ne ɔbea ntam no na ɛmma wontumi nni nkitaho wɔ aware mu
Such books as You Just Don t Understand and Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus promote the theory that men and women though speaking the same language have distinctly different communication styles
Nhoma ahorow te sɛ You Just Don’t Understand ne Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus kyerɛkyerɛ sɛ ɛwom sɛ mmarima ne mmea nyinaa ka kasa koro de nanso akwan a wɔnam so di nkitaho no sonsonoe
Unquestionably when Jehovah created woman from man she wasn t just a slightly revised model
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ bere a Yehowa bɔɔ ɔbea fii ɔbarima mu no na ɔbea no nyɛ abɔde foforo a wasakra no kakraa ara kwa
Man and woman were exquisitely and thoughtfully designed to complement each other physically emotionally mentally spiritually
Wɔbɔɔ ɔbarima ne ɔbea wɔ ɔkwan a ɛfata so yiye na wɔn mu biara ayɛ ɔfoforo mmoa wɔ honam nkate adwene ne honhom mu
Add to these innate differences the complexities of individual upbringing and life experience and the molding of people by culture environment and society s view of what is manly or womanly
Sɛ yeyi saa awosu mu nsonsonoe a egu ahorow a ankorankoro wɔ no to nkyɛn a ɔkwan a wɔnam so tete obi ne asetram osuahu ne su a amammerɛ ne nneɛma a atwa nnipa ho ahyia ama wɔanya ne adwene a amanfo kura wɔ nea ɛyɛ ɔbarima anaa ɔbea asɛyɛde ho no nso wɔ hɔ
Because of these influences it may be possible to isolate certain patterns in the way males and females communicate
Esiane saa nkɛntɛnso ahorow yi nti ebetumi aba sɛ wubesusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ mmarima ne mmea yɛ wɔn ade wɔ akwan pɔtee bi so wɔ nkitahodi mu
But the elusive typical man or typical woman may exist only in the pages of psychology books
Nanso asetra ankasa mu de ebia yennya obi a ɔyɛ ne biribiara sɛ ɔbarima ankasa anaasɛ ɔbea ankasa gye sɛ yɛn adwenem nko ara na yebetumi asusuw saa
Women are typically noted for their sensitivity yet many men are wonderfully tender in their dealings with people
Wonim sɛ mmea taa de nkate di dwuma nanso mmarima pii yɛ bɔkɔɔ wɔ wɔne afoforo nsɛnni mu ma ɛyɛ nwonwa
Logical thinking may be attributed more to men yet women often have keen analytical insight
Ebia wɔbɛka sɛ mmarima na wotumi susuw nsɛm ho yiye nanso mmea taa wɔ su a ɛma wotumi pɛɛpɛɛ nneɛma mu nya mu nhumu yiye
So while it is impossible to label any trait exclusively male or strictly female one thing is sure Insight into another s perspective may make the difference between peaceful coexistence and outright war especially in marriage
Enti bere a wontumi nkyerɛ su pɔtee bi a mmarima nkutoo na wɔwɔ anaa nea ɛyɛ mmea nkutoo de no ade biako da adi pefee Afoforo su mu nhumu a wobenya titiriw wɔ aware mu betumi ama wɔatumi akwati ɔko ankasa na wɔatra abom asomdwoe mu
The daily challenge of male female communication in marriage is a formidable one
Asɛnnennen a ɔbarima ne ɔbea hyia da biara da wɔ nkitahodi mu no tumi yɛ den ankasa
Many discerning husbands can testify that the deceivingly simple question How do you like my new hairdo ? 	Okununom a wɔwɔ nhumu pii betumi adi adanse sɛ asemmisa a ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ aniberesɛm biara te sɛ Wuhu sɛnea mayɛ me ti foforo yi dɛn ? 
can be fraught with dangers
betumi de ɔhaw pii aba
Many diplomatic wives learn to refrain from repeatedly asking Why don t you just ask for directions ? 	Ɔyerenom a wɔyɛ anifere pii gyae bisa a wɔbɛkɔ so abisa sɛ Dɛn nti na wammisa ma wɔankyerɛ wo kwan ? 
when their husbands become lost while traveling
bere a wɔ akwantu mu wɔn kununom yera no
Rather than belittle the seeming peculiarities of a mate and stubbornly cling to one s own because that s the way I am loving partners look below the surface
Sɛ anka wubebu wo hokafo su ahorow pɔtee bi sɛ ade a ɛmfra na wode mpiyɛ akura wo de mu aka sɛ saa na mete no ɔhokafo a ɔwɔ ɔdɔ hwɛ ade kɔ akyiri
This is not a cold scrutiny of each other s communication style but a warm gaze into each other s heart and mind
Eyi nyɛ adwemmɔne a ɔfoforo de pɛɛpɛɛ ɔkwan a ne yɔnko fa so bɔ nkɔmmɔ mu na mmom ɛyɛ anigye a ɔfoforo de hwehwɛ nea ɛwɔ ne yɔnko koma ne n’adwene mu
As each person is unique so is each blend of two individuals in marriage
Sɛnea onipa biara da nsow no saa ara nso na ɛsono nnipa baanu a wɔaka abom wɔ aware mu no mu biara
A true meeting of minds and hearts is no accident but requires hard work because of our imperfect human nature
Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛ adwene ne koma behyia na mmom egye mmɔdenbɔ esiane sɛ yɛnyɛ pɛ
For instance it is so easy to assume that others view things the same as we do
Sɛ nhwɛso no ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa sɛ wubesusuw sɛ afoforo hu nneɛma sɛnea wuhu no no
We often fill the needs of others the way we would want them filled for us perhaps trying to follow the Golden Rule All things therefore that you want men to do to you you also must likewise do to them
Yɛtaa di afoforo ahiade ho dwuma wɔ ɔkwan a anka yɛbɛpɛ sɛ wɔfa so di yɛn de ho dwuma ma yɛn de kyerɛ sɛ ebia yɛrebɔ mmɔden sɛ yebedi Mmara Pa a ɛne sɛ Ade biara a mopɛ sɛ nnipa nyɛ mma mo no mo nso monyɛ wɔn saa ara no so
However Jesus did not mean that what you want should be good enough for others
Nanso na Yesu nkyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ afoforo ani gye nea wopɛ ho
Rather you wish others would give what you need or want
Mmom no sɛ wo yam a anka afoforo ayɛ nea wuhia anaa wopɛ ama wo
So you should give what they need
Enti ɛsɛ sɛ woma wɔn nea wɔpɛ
Especially is this vital in marriage for each has vowed to meet the needs of his or her mate as fully as possible
Eyi ho hia titiriw wɔ aware mu efisɛ mo mu biara aka ntam sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne hokafo ahiade ama no koraa sɛnea obetumi biara
Pam and Jerry have taken such a vow
Adwoa ne Yaw aka saa ntam yi
And their marital union of two years has been a happy one
Na wɔn aware a adi mfe abien no ayɛ nea anigye wom
However even though they feel they know each other quite well situations sometimes erupt that reveal a yawning communication gap that good intentions alone cannot bridge
Nanso ɛwom mpo sɛ wɔte nka sɛ wonim wɔn ho yiye de nanso ɛtɔ da bi na sɛ tebea ahorow sɔre a ɛma ɛda adi sɛ nkitahodi pa biara nni hɔ a adwempa a wɔwɔ nkutoo ntumi mma wonsiesie tebea no
The heart of the wise one causes his mouth to show insight says Proverbs
Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Onyansafo koma kyerɛ n’ano nimdeɛ
Yes insight in communication is the needed key
Yiw ade a ehia wɔ nkɔmmɔbɔ mu ne nhumu
Let s see what doors it unlocks for Jerry and Pam
Momma yɛnhwɛ nea eyi yɛ maa Yaw ne Adwoa
One Man s View	Ɔbarima Bi Adwene
Jerry navigates in a competitive world where each man must assume his place in a social order whether a subordinate or a superior in a given situation
Yaw yɛ adwuma wɔ akansi wiase a ɛsɛ sɛ onipa biara kura n’asetra mu dibea mu sɛ ɔyɛ akumaa anaa ɔpanyin wɔ adwuma bi a wɔde ahyɛ ne nsa mu
Communication serves to establish his position competence expertise or worth
Nkitahodi boa no ma okura ne dibea fata a ɔfata n’ahokokwaw anaa ɛbo a ɔsom mu
His independence is precious to him
N’ahofadi ho hia no kɛse
So when given orders in a demanding way Jerry finds himself resistant
Enti Yaw ko tia nneɛma a wobisa no ɔhyɛ so
The subtle message You re not doing your job makes him rebel even if the request is a logical one
Anifere kwan so asɛm Wonyɛ w’adwuma ma no tew atua sɛ nea wɔkae no yɛ nokware mpo a
Jerry converses basically to exchange information
Yaw di nkɔmmɔ de hwehwɛ nneɛma mu titiriw
He likes to talk about facts ideas and new things he has learned
N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔka nokwasɛm nsusuwii ne nneɛma afoforo a wasua kyerɛ afoforo
When listening Jerry seldom interrupts the speaker even with little responses such as uh huh yeah because he is absorbing information
Sɛ Yaw retie obi a ɛyɛ den sɛ ɔbɛka biribi ketewaa te sɛ saa yoo de atware ɔkasa no mu efisɛ ɔresua biribi afi nsɛm a ɔreka akyerɛ no no mu
But if he disagrees he may not hesitate to say so especially with a friend
Nanso sɛ ɔne ɔkasafo no nyɛ adwene a ebia ɔntwentwɛn ne nan ase sɛ ɔbɛda no adi titiriw sɛ onipa no yɛ n’adamfo a
It shows that he is interested in what his friend has to say exploring all the possibilities
Ɛkyerɛ sɛ n’ani gye nea n’adamfo no ka no ho a ɔhwehwɛ nea obetumi anya afi mu biara
If Jerry has a problem he prefers to work out a solution on his own
Sɛ biribi haw Yaw a n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔno nko ara di ho dwuma
So he may withdraw from everyone and everything else
Enti ebia ɔbɛtwe ne ho afi afoforo ne biribiara ho koraa
Or he may seek to relax with some diversion to forget his dilemma temporarily
Anaasɛ ebia ɔbɛpɛ biribi foforo ayɛ de ayi n’adwene afi ne haw no so bere tiaa bi
He will discuss it only if he is seeking advice
Ɔbɛka ho asɛm bere a ɔrehwehwɛ ho afotu nkutoo
If a man comes to Jerry with a problem as Bill did Jerry realizes that it s his job to help taking care not to make his friend feel incompetent
Sɛ ɔbarima bi de ne haw ba Yaw hɔ sɛnea Kwame yɛe no a ohu sɛ ɛyɛ n’adwuma sɛ ɔboa na ɔyɛ ahwɛyiye sɛ ɔmma n’adamfo no nte nka sɛ ɔmfata
He ll usually share some troubles of his own along with the advice so that his friend won t feel alone
Ɔtaa de n’ankasa ne haw ahorow ka n’afotu no ho sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a n’adamfo no nte nka sɛ ɔno nkutoo na biribi haw no
Jerry likes to share activities with friends
Yaw ani gye ho sɛ ɔne nnamfo bɛyɛ nneɛma abom
Companionship to him means doing things together
Wɔ ne fam no nea adamfofa kyerɛ ara ne sɛ wɔbɛyɛ nneɛma abom
Home is for Jerry a refuge from the arena a place where he no longer has to talk to prove himself where he is accepted trusted loved and appreciated
Ofie yɛ guankɔbea ma Yaw beae a ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔkasa de kyerɛkyerɛ nsɛm mu beae wogye no tom wɔdɔ no na wɔkyerɛ ne ho anisɔ
Even so Jerry occasionally finds that he needs solitude
Ɛno mpo no ɛtɔ da bi a Yaw te nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ne nkutoo kɔtra baabi
It may have nothing to do with Pam or anything she s done
Ebia ɛnyɛ Adwoa anaa biribi a wayɛ nti na ɔyɛ saa
He just needs some time alone
Nea ohia ara ne bere a ɔno nkutoo de bɛtra baabi
Jerry finds it difficult to reveal his fears insecurities and pains to his wife
Ɛyɛ den ma Yaw sɛ ɔbɛda nneɛma a ɛhaw no adi akyerɛ ne yere
He doesn t want her to worry
Ɔmpɛ sɛ ne yere bɛhaw
His job is to care for and protect her and he needs Pam to trust him to do so
N’adwuma ne sɛ ɔbɛhwɛ no abɔ ne ho ban na ɔpɛ sɛ Adwoa nya ne mu ahotoso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
While Jerry wants support he doesn t want pity
Bere a Yaw hia mmoa no ɔmpɛ sɛ obi behu no mmɔbɔ
It makes him feel incompetent or useless
Ɛma ɔte nka sɛ ɔmfata anaasɛ mfaso nni no so
One Woman s Perspective	Ɔbea Bi Adwene
Pam sees herself as an individual in a world of social connections with others
Adwoa hu ne ho sɛ ɔte wiase bi a nkitahodi pii wom mu
To her it is important to establish and strengthen the bonds of these relationships
Wɔ ne fam no ɛho hia sɛ onya saa nkitahodi yi mu kyɛfa na anya nkɔso
Talk is an important way to create and confirm closeness
Kasa ne ɔkwan a ɔnam so bɛn afoforo na ɔkyerɛ sɛ ɔne wɔn wɔ abusuabɔ
Dependence comes naturally to Pam
Adwoa fi awosu mu pɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to afoforo so
She feels loved if Jerry finds out her views before making a decision though she wants him to take the lead
Sɛ Yaw bisa n’adwene ansa na wasi gyinae bi a ɛma ɔte nka sɛ ɔdɔ no ɛwom sɛ ɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ Yaw bedi anim de
When she has to make a decision she likes to consult her husband not necessarily so that he will tell her what to do but to show her closeness to and reliance on him
Sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ osi gyinae bi a n’ani gye ho sɛ ohu ne kunu ansa a ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ne kunu ka nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ kyerɛ no na mmom ɔyɛ de kyerɛ sɛnea ɔbɛn no na ɔde ne ho to ne so
It s very hard for Pam to come right out and say she needs something
Sɛ Adwoa hia biribi a ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔbɛka no tee
She doesn t want to nag Jerry or make him feel that she is unhappy
Ɔmpɛ sɛ onwiinwii kyerɛ Yaw anaasɛ ɔma ɔte nka sɛ onni anigye
Instead she waits to be noticed or drops hints
Mmom no ɔtwɛn kosi sɛ ne kunu ankasa behu anaa ɔno ankasa bɛfa anifere kwan so de ɛho nsusuwii ahorow aba
When Pam converses she is intrigued by minute details and asks many questions
Sɛ Adwoa redi nkɔmmɔ a n’ani gye sɛ obehu nneɛma nketenkete mu na obisa nsɛm bebree
This is natural because of her sensitivity to and intense interest in people and relationships
Eyi te saa efisɛ n’ani ku nnipa ne abusuabɔ a ɔne wɔn benya ho
When Pam listens she punctuates the speaker s words with interjections nods or queries to show that she is following the speaker and cares about what he or she has to say
Sɛ Adwoa retie obi a ɔde nsɛm ne ti nko a ɔbɔ ne nsemmisa twitwa ɔkasafo no ano de kyerɛ sɛ odi nea ɔreka no akyi na odwen nea ɔka no ho
She works hard to know intuitively what people need
Ɔbɔ mmɔden yiye sɛ obehu nkurɔfo ahiade
Offering help without being asked is a wonderful way to show love
Afoforo a ɔboa wɔn bere a wommisae ne ɔkwan biako a eye a ɔnam so yi ɔdɔ adi kyerɛ
She especially wants to help her husband to grow and improve
Titiriw no ɔpɛ sɛ ɔboa ne kunu ma ne ho kokwaw na onya nkɔso
When Pam has a problem she may feel overwhelmed
Sɛ Adwoa hyia ɔhaw bi a ebia ɛbɛhyɛ ne so
She must talk not so much to seek a solution but to express her feelings
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkasa ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔrehwehwɛ ano aduru na mmom ɔyɛ saa de da ne nkate adi
She needs to know that someone understands and cares
Ɔpɛ sɛ ohu sɛ obi te no ase na odwen ne ho
When her emotions are excited Pam makes sweeping dramatic statements
Sɛ Adwoa koma ka ne ho a ɔkeka nsɛm pii a ɛyɛ nwonwa
She doesn t mean it literally when she says You never listen ! 	Sɛ ɔka sɛ Wuntie nea meka da ! a ɔnkyerɛ saa ankasa
Pam s best childhood friend was not one that she did things with but one that she talked about everything with
Na ɛnyɛ Adwoa mmofraberem adamfo ne nea ɔne no yɛ nneɛma bom na mmom nea na ɔka n’asɛm nyinaa kyerɛ no
So in marriage she is not nearly as interested in outside activities as she is in an empathetic listener with whom she may share her feelings
Enti aware mu no n’ani nnye adwuma a obefi fie akɔyɛ sɛ otiefo a ɔwɔ tema a obetumi aka ne nkate horow ho asɛm akyerɛ no a obenya
Home is a place where Pam can talk without being judged
Ofie ne beae a Adwoa betumi akasa a wommu no atɛn
She doesn t hesitate to reveal her fears and troubles to Jerry
Ɔntwentwɛn ne nan ase sɛ ɔbɛda ne haw ahorow adi akyerɛ Yaw
If in need of help she is not ashamed to admit it for she trusts that her husband is there for her and cares enough to listen
Sɛ ohia mmoa a ɛnyɛ no aniwu sɛ obegye atom efisɛ ɔwɔ ahotoso sɛ ne kunu wɔ hɔ na obetie no
Pam usually feels loved and secure in her marriage
Adwoa taa te nka sɛ ne kunu dɔ no na ɔbɔ ne ho ban wɔ n’aware mu
But occasionally for no apparent reason she begins feeling insecure and unloved and urgently needs reassurance and companionship
Nanso ɛtɔ mmere bi a bere a onhuu hwee no ofi ase te nka sɛ onni ahobammɔ na ne kunu nnɔ no na ehia sɛ onya awerɛhyem ne fekubɔ ntɛm
Yes Jerry and Pam complements of each other are quite different
Yiw Yaw ne Adwoa yɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho mmoa na wɔn mu biara da nsow
The differences between them create the potential for grave misunderstandings even though both may have the best of intentions to be loving and supportive
Nsonsonoe a ɛda wɔn ntam no de akasakasa a emu yɛ den ba ɛwom mpo sɛ wɔn mu biara wɔ adwempa sɛ ɔbɛdɔ ne yɔnko aboa no de
If we could hear each one s perspective on the above situation what would they say ?	Sɛ yebetumi ate nea wɔn mu biara susuw wɔ tebea a yɛaka ho asɛm wɔ atifi hɔ no ho a anka dɛn na wɔbɛka ?
What They Saw Through Their Own Eyes	Nea Wɔde Wɔn Ani Hui
 The minute I walked through the door I could see that Pam was upset Jerry would say
Yaw bɛka sɛ Bere a miduu fie pɛ na mihui sɛ Adwoa ahaw
I assumed that when she was ready she would tell me why
Misusuwii sɛ sɛ ɔyɛ krado a ɔbɛka dekode a ɛhaw no
The problem didn t seem so major to me
Ɛyɛɛ me sɛ ɔhaw no nyɛ aniberesɛm biara
I thought if I just helped her to see that she didn t need to be so upset and that the solution was easy she d feel better
Misusuwii sɛ sɛ meboa no ara ma ohu sɛ enhia sɛ ɔma asɛm no haw no saa na meka sɛ asɛm no nyɛ den a ne bo bɛtɔ ne yam
It really hurt after I listened to her when she said You never listen to me ! 	Bere a ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ Wuntie m’asɛm ! ’ no metee nka sɛ nea mekae no piraa no ankasa
I felt as if she were blaming me for all her frustration ! 	Metee nka te sɛ nea ɔde ne haw no nyinaa ho asodi reto me so ! 
 The whole day had been one big disaster Pam would explain
Adwoa bɛkyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Ɛda no yɛɛ ɔhaw nkutoo
I knew it wasn t Jerry s fault
Na minim sɛ mfomso no mfi Yaw
But when he came in all cheery I felt he was ignoring the fact that I was upset
Nanso bere a ɔde anigye baa fie no metee nka sɛ nea na ɔrebu n’ani agu nokwasɛm a ɛyɛ sɛ na mahaw no so
Why didn t he ask me what was wrong ?	Dɛn nti na wammisa me nea na aba ?
When I told him the problem he basically said I was being silly that the whole thing was petty
Bere a mekaa ɔhaw no kyerɛɛ no no nea ɔkae no kyerɛ sɛ m’adwene sua na asɛm no nyɛ asɛm biara
Instead of saying he understood how I felt Jerry the repairman told me how to fix the problem
Sɛ anka ɔbɛka sɛ ɔte me nkate ase no Yaw a osiesie nsɛm no kyerɛɛ me sɛnea minni asɛm no ho dwuma
I didn t want solutions I wanted sympathy ! 	Na ɛnyɛ ano aduru na merepɛ na mihia tema ! 
Despite the appearances of this temporary breach Jerry and Pam love each other very much
Ɛmfa ho saa bere tiaa mu akasakasa a ɛkɔ so ba wɔn ntam no Yaw ne Adwoa dɔ wɔn ho yiye
What insights will help them express that love clearly ?	Nneɛma ahorow bɛn na sɛ wohu a ɛbɛboa wɔn ma wɔatumi ada saa ɔdɔ no adi yiye ?
Seeing Through Each Other s Eyes	Nea Afoforo Hu a Wobehu
Jerry felt that it would be intrusive to ask Pam what was wrong so he naturally did for her what he would want others to do for him
Yaw tee nka sɛ ɛbɛyɛ asɛmpɛ sɛ obebisa Adwoa nea asi enti ɔyɛɛ ade a ɔbɛpɛ sɛ afoforo yɛ ma no no maa no
He waited for her to open up and speak
Enti ɔtwɛnee sɛ ɔno ankasa befi ne pɛ mu akasa
Now Pam was upset not just over the problem but over the fact that Jerry seemed to ignore her plea for his support
Afei Adwoa nso hawee a na ɛnyɛ tebea a asi no nti na mmom nokwasɛm a ɛyɛ sɛ na ayɛ sɛ nea Yaw abu n’ani agu ne mmoa a ɔrehwehwɛ so no
She didn t see his silence as a gesture of gentle respect she saw it as uncaring
Wanhu sɛ komm a na Yaw ayɛ no yɛ ahobrɛase mu a na ofi reda obu adi akyerɛ no ohui sɛ ɛkyerɛ dwen a onnwen ne ho
When Pam finally spoke Jerry listened without interrupting
Awiei koraa bere a Adwoa kasae no Yaw tiee no a wantwitwa n’ano
But she felt he wasn t really hearing her feelings
Nanso ɔtee nka sɛ na ɛnyɛ ade a ɔretie no ankasa
Then he offered not empathy but a solution
Afei wanna tema adi na mmom sɛnea obedi ɔhaw no ho dwuma na ɔkyerɛe
This said to her Your feelings are invalid you re overreacting
Ɔtee eyi ase sɛ na ɔreka akyerɛ no sɛ Ɛho nhia sɛ wote nka saa woreyɛ ade atra so dodo
See how easy it is to solve this little problem ? 	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobedi saa ɔhaw ketewaa yi ho dwuma

How different things would have been if each had been able to see things from the other s viewpoint !	Hwɛ sɛnea anka nneɛma bɛyɛ soronko afa sɛ wɔn mu biara tumi huu nneɛma sɛnea ɔfoforo hu no no a !
It might have gone like this 	Anka asɛm no bɛba sɛ 
Jerry comes home to find Pam upset
Yaw ba fie behu Adwoa sɛ wahaw
What s wrong dear ? 	Obisa no brɛoo sɛ Dɛn asɛm me dɔfo ? 
he asks gently
Tears start to flow and words just tumble out
Nusu gu no na ofi ase ka n’asɛm
Pam doesn t say It s all your fault ! 	Adwoa nka sɛ Ne nyinaa fi wo ! 
or imply that Jerry isn t doing enough
anaa biribi a ɛbɛkyerɛ sɛ Yaw mmɔ ne ho mmɔden sɛnea ɛsɛ
Jerry holds her close and listens patiently
Yaw ka no fam ne ho na ɔde abotare tie no
When she is finished he says I m sorry you re feeling bad
Sɛ ɔka n’asɛm wie a Yaw ka sɛ Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ woahaw
I can see why you re so upset
Mitumi hu nea enti a woayɛ basaa saa no
Pam replies Thanks so much for listening
Adwoa bua sɛ Meda wo ase pii sɛ woatie me
I feel much better knowing you understand
Bere a mahu sɛ wote me ase yi me ho abae me
Sadly instead of solving their differences many couples simply choose to end their marriage in divorce
Nea ɛyɛ awerɛhow ne sɛ sɛ anka wobedi wɔn ntam ntawntawdi ho dwuma mmom no awarefo bebree gyae aware
Lack of communication is the villain that devastates many homes
Nkitaho a wonni ne ade bɔne a ɛsɛe aware pii
Arguments explode that shake the very foundations of the marriage
Wɔkasakasa araa ma aware no nnyinaso sɛe
How does it happen ?	Ɔkwan bɛn na eyi nam so ba ?
The next article tells how it happens and how to avoid it
Asɛm a edi hɔ no bɛka ɔkwan a ɛnam so ba ne sɛnea wɔkwati ho asɛm
Anatomy of an Argument	Nea Ɛde Akasakasa Ba a Wɔhwehwɛ Mu
SHE needs to air feelings
ƆBEA pɛ sɛ ɔka ne nkate kyerɛ
He wants to give solutions
Ɔbarima pɛ sɛ ɔkyerɛ sɛnea wodi ho dwuma
The millions of marital arguments down through time may have had many different tunes but they have often been variations on a few basic themes
Ebia anka aware mu akasakasa ɔpepem pii a akɔ so mfe pii mu no bɛyɛ biribi foforo koraa nanso nea ɛtaa ba ne sɛ wɔn adwene nhyia wɔ nsɛm nketenkete bi ho
Understanding your mate s different perspective or communication style may help reduce these blazing forest fires to glowing charcoal in the hearth of a happy home
Wo hokafo su anaa sɛnea odi nkitaho a ɛne wo de nhyia a wobɛte ase no betumi aboa ma mo fie a ɛredɛw sɛ kwae a ogya atom no adan ayɛ gyabiriw a egu bukyia mu wɔ ofie a emu yɛ anigye mu
Don t Run My Life ! 	 Nhyɛ Me So ! 
The stereotype of the domineering nagging wife may hit home with many a husband who finds himself hemmed in at every turn with advice requests and criticisms
Ebia ɔyere a ɔyɛ nhyɛso ne anwiinwii nam afotu adesrɛ ne kasatia a ɔkɔ so de haw ne kunu daa no so remma no nnya ahotɔ koraa
The Bible acknowledges such feelings saying The contentions of a wife are as a leaking roof that drives one away
Bible ka nkate a ɛte saa ho asɛm bere ɛka sɛ Ɔbea atutupɛ yɛ daa nsosɔe
A wife may make a request that her husband silently resists for reasons unknown to her
Ɔyere betumi abisa ne kunu biribi na barima no aka no bɔkɔɔ sɛ dabi esiane biribi a ɔbea no nnim nti
Thinking he didn t hear this time she tells him what to do
Bere a ɔyere no susuw sɛ okunu no ante no afei ɔbea no kyerɛ no nea ɔnyɛ
His resistance stiffens
Pow a ɔbarima no pow sɛ ɔbɛyɛ abisade no mu yɛ den
A nagging wife and hen pecked husband ?	So ɔyɛ ɔyere a ɔyɛ anwiinwii na ɔhyɛ ne kunu so ?
Or two people who simply haven t communicated clearly ?	Anaasɛ wɔyɛ nnipa baanu a wonnyee bere mfa nnii nkitaho yiye ?
From a wife s perspective she best expresses her love for her husband when she offers helpful advice
Ɔyere adwenem no ɔte nka sɛ sɛ ɔde afotu a ɛboa ma ne kunu a na ɔreda ɔdɔ adi akyerɛ no
In her husband s view she is ordering him around and implying that he is incompetent
Wɔ ne kunu adwenem no ɔte nka sɛ ne yere rema no akwankyerɛ a ɛkyerɛ sɛ ontumi nni n’asɛyɛde ho dwuma
Don t forget your briefcase is for her a statement of caring making sure he has what he needs
Wɔ ɔyere fam no Mma wo werɛ mmfi wo bag no a ɔka no kyerɛ dwen a odwen ne kunu ho a ɔyɛ saa de boa no na wannya biribiara hɔ
It reminds him of his mother calling out the door after him Did you take your mittens ? 	Ɛkae okunu no sɛnea na ne maame di n’akyi begyina abɔnten so frɛ no ka sɛ Wofaa wo krataa no ? 
A weary wife may gently say Do you want to eat out tonight ? 	Ebia ɔyere a wabrɛ bebisa ne kunu brɛoo sɛ So wobɛkɔ akodidi kurom anwummere yi ? 
really meaning Won t you take me out to dinner ?	a nea ɔrepɛ akyerɛ ankasa ne sɛ Womma yenkodidi kurom ?
I m too tired to cook
Mabrɛ dodo sɛ metumi anoa aduan
But her devoted husband may seize the moment to praise her cooking and swear that he prefers it to any other
Nanso ebia ne kunu a ɔdɔ no yiye no de hokwan yi bɛkamfo n’aduannoa na wakyerɛ sɛ n’ani gye n’aduannoa ho sen onipa foforo biara de
Or he may feel She s trying to manipulate me ! 	Anaasɛ ebia ɔbɛte nka sɛ Ɔrebɔ mmɔden sɛ obedi me so ! ’
Meanwhile a wife may resentfully say to herself Why should I have to ask ? 	Saa bere yi ebia ɔyere no de abufuw bɛka wɔ ne tirim sɛ Ɛyɛɛ dɛn mpo na mibisae yi ? ’
 You Don t Love Me ! 	 Wonnɔ Me ! 
 How can she think that ? exclaims a frustrated perplexed husband
Okunu a n’abam abu na wayɛ basaa no bisa ne ho sɛ Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw saa ?
 I work pay the bills even bring her flowers sometimes ! 	Meyɛ adwuma tua aka ahorow na ɛtɔ da bi a mede nneɛma nketenkete a n’ani gye ho mpo brɛ no ! 
While all humans need to feel loved a woman has a special need to be repeatedly reassured of this
Bere a nnipa nyinaa pɛ sɛ wɔte nka sɛ wɔdɔ wɔn no ɛho hia titiriw sɛ ɔkɔ so si so dua mpɛn pii kyerɛ ɔbea no sɛ ɔdɔ no
She may not say so aloud but inside she may feel like an unwanted burden especially if her monthly cycle is dealing her a dose of the blues
Ebia ɔrenka eyi wɔ n’ano de nanso obetumi ate nka wɔ ne mu sɛ gyama ɔyɛ adesoa bi a ne ho nhia no na eyi te saa titiriw wɔ mmere ahorow a ne brayɛ ma no haw no
On such occasions her husband may withdraw thinking she wants some time to herself
Ebia wɔ mmere a ɛte saa mu no ne kunu bɛtwe ne ho afi ne ho a osusuw sɛ ne yere hia bere bi a ɔde bɛyɛ ne nneɛma
She may interpret his lack of closeness as a confirmation of her worst fear he doesn t love her anymore
Ebia ɔbea no bɛte bɛn a ne kunu mmɛn no no ase sɛ biribi a esi ehu a ɛwɔ ne mu no so dua sɛ ɔnnɔ no bio
She might lash out seeking to force him to love and support her
Ebia ɔbɛkasa abufuw so akyerɛ ne kunu a ɔnam saayɛ so rehyɛ no ma wadɔ no na waboa no
What s Wrong Honey ? 	 Dɛn Asɛm Ɔdɔ ? 
A man s response to a stressful problem may be to seek a quiet place to ponder over it
Ɔkwan a ɔbarima nam so di ɔhaw bi a ɛyɛ den ho dwuma ne sɛ ebia ɔbɛkɔ akɔhyɛ beae bi a ɛhɔ yɛ dinn na wasusuw ho
A woman may intuitively sense some tension and instinctively react by trying to pull him out of his self dug hole
Ebia ɔbea befi nkate mu ahu sɛ ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ na wabɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛma no akasa
However well meaning these efforts are a husband may find them intrusive and humiliating
Nanso ɛmfa ho adwempa a ɔde yɛ saa no ebia okunu bebu saa a ɔyɛ no sɛ asɛmpɛ ne n’anim ase a ɔregu
As he retreats to consider his problem he glances over his shoulder to see his loyal wife trotting behind in hot pursuit
Bere a ɔsan sɛ ɔrekɔtra ase asusuw ne haw no ho no otwa n’ani hwɛ n’akyi na ohu ne yere nokwafo no sɛ ɔde akokoduru di n’akyi
He hears that persistent loving voice Honey are you all right ?	Ɔte asɛm a efi ɔdɔ mu a ɔkɔ so ka no Ɔdɔ adɛn ?
What s wrong ?	Dɛn asɛm ?
Let s talk about it
Ma yɛnka ho asɛm
If there is no reply a wife may feel hurt
Sɛ wammua no a ebia ebepira ɔyere no
When she has a problem she wants to talk it out with him
Sɛ biribi haw no a ɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne ne kunu besusuw ho
But the man she loves doesn t want to share his feelings
Nanso ɔbarima a ɔdɔ no no mpɛ sɛ ɔka ne nkate kyerɛ no
He must not love me anymore may be her conclusion
Ebia nea ɔbɛka ara ne sɛ ɔnnɔ me bio
So when the unsuspecting man finally emerges from his inner world content with the solution he has found he also finds not the concerned loving mate he left behind but a riled wife ready to challenge him for leaving her out in the cold
Enti awiei koraa no bere a ɔbarima a ɔnhwɛ kwan no fi beae a ɔkɔhyɛe apue a ɔhaw no ho adwene a wafa no ama ne koma atɔ ne yam no ommehu ɔyere a ɔwɔ dɔ a osusuw ne ho a ɔne no ammom ansusuw ne haw no ho no na mmom ɔyere a ne bo afuw na wayɛ krado a ɔrebebisa no nea enti a wanka nea asi ankyerɛ no no
You Never Listen to Me ! 	 Wuntie Me Da ! 
The charge seems ludicrous
Sobo no te sɛ aseresɛm bi
It seems to him that all he ever does is listen
Ɛyɛ ɔbarima no sɛ nea ɔyɛ bere nyinaa ne sɛ obetie no
But as his wife talks she has the distinct feeling that her words are being screened and analyzed by a computer solving a math problem
Nanso bere a ne yere kasa no ɔbea no nya nkate bi sɛ obedi n’asɛm no ho dwuma te sɛ kɔmputa bi a wɔde bu akontaa
Her suspicions are confirmed when right in the middle of a sentence he says Well why don t you just
? 	Sɛ ɔrekasa na sɛ ne kunu twa n’ano ka sɛ Eye adɛn nti na wo
? a ɛma ohu sɛ nea osusuwii no yɛ nokware
When a wife comes to her husband with a problem very often she is neither laying the blame on him nor looking for a solution from him
Ɛnyɛ sobo a ɔbɛbɔ ne kunu anaasɛ ano aduru a ɔyere hwehwɛ nti na ɔde ne haw ba ne kunu nkyɛn
What she wants most is a sympathetic ear that will hear not just the cold facts but her feelings about it
Nea ohia titiriw ara ne obi a ɔde tema betie no a ɛnyɛ nokwasɛm kɛkɛ na obetie na mmom sɛnea ɔbea no te nka wɔ ho no nso
Then she wants not advice but validation of her feelings
Afei ɛnyɛ asɛm no ho afotu na ɔpɛ na mmom ne nkate a wobegye atom sɛ ɛfata
That s why many a well meaning husband has triggered an explosion when all he said was Sweetheart you shouldn t feel that way
Ɛno nti na okununom pii a wɔwɔ adwempa akanyan wɔn yerenom abufuw bere a nea wɔka ara ne sɛ Me dɔfo ɛnsɛ sɛ wote nka saa
It s not that bad
Asɛm no nyɛ aniberesɛm sɛnea wususuw no
Oftentimes people expect their mates to be mind readers
Mpɛn pii no nkurɔfo hwɛ kwan sɛ wɔn ahokafo betumi ahu nea wosusuw
We ve been married for years said one man
Ɔbarima bi kae sɛ Yɛaware mfe ni
If she doesn t know what I want by now she must not care or is not paying attention
Na sɛ ebesi nnɛ onnim nea mepɛ a na ɛkyerɛ sɛ onnwen me ho anaa ontie me
One author states in his book on the marriage relationship When partners don t tell each other what they want and constantly criticize each other for missing the boat it s no wonder that the spirit of love and cooperation disappears
Ɔkyerɛwfo bi kae wɔ ne nhoma a ɛfa aware mu nkitahodi ho mu sɛ Sɛ awarefo nka nea wohia nkyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho na wɔkɔ so kasa tia wɔn ho wɔn ho wɔ adeyɛ bi a ɛfata a wɔn nsa nka ho a ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɔdɔ ne biakoyɛ honhom befi wɔn mu
In its place comes
the power struggle in which each partner tries to force the other to meet his or her needs
Akansi honhom besi ananmu
a ɛma ahokafo no mu biara bɔ mmɔden hyɛ ɔfoforo so sɛ ɔnyɛ n’ahiade mma no
You re So Irresponsible ! 	 Wunni W’asɛyɛde Ho Dwuma Koraa ! 
A wife may not say so outright to her husband but she can imply it just as clearly in her tone of voice
Ebia ɔyere nka no pɔtee nkyerɛ ne kunu de nanso ɔnam ne nne a ɔde kasa so betumi akyerɛ saa pefee
Why are you so late ? 	 Dɛn nti na woamma ntɛm koraa saa ? 
could be seen as a request for information
betumi ayɛ asemmisa a wɔde hwehwɛ biribi
More likely though her accusing look and hand on hip says to her husband You irresponsible little boy you had me worried
Nanso n’anim yɛbea ne ne nsa a ɔde asisi ne sisi no ka kyerɛ ne kunu sɛ Abarimaa a onni n’asɛyɛde ho dwuma woahaw me
Why didn t you call ?	Dɛn nti na woamfrɛ me telefon so ?
You re so inconsiderate !	Wunnwen me ho koraa !
Now dinner is ruined ! 	Saa bere yi yɛn aduan no asɛe ! 
She is right of course about dinner
Nokwarem no ɛdefa aduan no ho de nea ɔkae no teɛ
But if an argument erupts is their relationship at risk as well ?	Nanso sɛ akasakasa sɔre a so wɔn nkitahodi nso bɛtɔ asiane mu ?
 Most arguments occur not because two people disagree but because either the man feels that the woman disapproves of his point of view or the woman disapproves of the way he is talking to her notes Dr
Ɔbenfo John Gray ka sɛ Akasakasa pii sisi a ɛnyɛ sɛ nnipa no nte wɔn ho ase na mmom ɔbarima no te nka sɛ ɔbea no nnye nea ɔka no ntom anaa ɔbea no nso ani nnye ɔkwan a ɔnam so kasa kyerɛ no no ho
John Gray
Some are of the opinion that at home one should be free to let the words fly unrestrained
Ebinom wɔ adwene sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obiara nya hokwan keka nea ɔpɛ biara wɔ fie a obi nsi no kwan
But a good communicator seeks to work out an accord and achieve peace considering the listener s feelings
Nanso nkitahodifo pa biara hwehwɛ ɔkwampa a ɔnam so bɛma biakoyɛ aba ɔne ne yɔnko ntam na wɔanya asomdwoe a osusuw ne tiefo no nkate ho
We might roughly compare such talk to serving your spouse a glass of ice water as opposed to splashing it in his or her face
Yebetumi de ɔkasa a ɛte saa no atoto nsunwunu a ɛwɔ kuruwa mu a wode ma wo hokafo a ɛnyɛ sɛ wode regyam n’ani so no ho
We could say the difference is all in the delivery
Yebetumi aka sɛ nsonsonoe a ɛwom ara ne ɔkwan a wonam so ka wo nsɛm no
Applying the words of Colossians will dissipate arguments and usher in a happy home Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion kindness lowliness of mind mildness and long suffering
Kolosefo a wode bedi dwuma no beyi akasakasa afi hɔ na ɛde asomdwoe aba ofie Monhyɛ ayamhyehye ayamye ahobrɛase adwene odwo abodwokyɛre
Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another
Na sɛ obi ne obi nya asɛm bi a munhuhu mma mo ho na momfa nkyekyɛ mo ho sɛnea Yehowa de akyɛ mo no sɛnea mo nso monyɛ ne no
But besides all these things clothe yourselves with love for it is a perfect bond of union
Na eyinom nyinaa so na monhyɛ ɔdɔ a ɛne pɛyɛ hama no ngu

Here is what the Bible book of Proverbs recommends By wisdom a household will be built up and by discernment it will prove firmly established
And by knowledge will the interior rooms be filled with all precious and pleasant things of value
Nea Bible mu nhoma a ɛne Mmebusɛm kamfo kyerɛ ni Wɔde nyansa na esi dan na wɔde nhumu ma egyina na wɔnam nimdeɛ so de ahode aboɔdenne afɛfɛde nyinaa hyɛ mpia mama
Yes it takes wisdom discernment and knowledge to build a happy home
Yiw egye nyansa nhumu ne nimdeɛ na wɔde asi ofie a asomdwoe wom
Who does the building ?	Hena na osi dan no ?
 The truly wise woman has built up her house but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands
Ɔbea nyansafo si ne dan na ɔbea kwasea de ne nsa dwiriw
The same is true for the wise man who sees that it is within his hands to make his marriage strong and happy or weak and miserable
Ɛte saa ara wɔ ɔbarima nyansafo a ohu sɛ ɛnam ne so na n’aware bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den na asomdwoe wom anaasɛ nea emu nyɛ den na awerɛhow wom no nso fam
What factors make the difference ?	Nneɛma ahorow bɛn na ɛde anigye anaa awerɛhow ba ?
How interesting that the suggestions of some modern marriage counselors so closely parallel the timeless wisdom of God s Word written thousands of years ago
Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ anigye sɛ nyansahyɛ ahorow bi a nnɛyi aware ho afotufo de ma ne Onyankopɔn Asɛm no mu nyansa a enni awiei a wɔkyerɛwee mfe mpempem a atwam ni no di nsɛ
Listening Really listening is one of the greatest compliments you can pay to another person and is crucial in building and maintaining an intimate relationship says a marriage handbook
Asɛm a wotie Nhoma ketewaa bi a ɛka aware ho asɛm ka sɛ Asɛm a wotie no yiye ne nneɛma atitiriw a wɔyɛ de kyerɛ obu no mu biako a wubetumi ayi adi akyerɛ onipa foforo na etumi de abusuabɔ a emu yɛ den a ɛtra hɔ kyɛ ba
The ear of wise ones seeks to find knowledge states the Proverb
Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Anyansafo aso hwehwɛ nimdeɛ akyi kwan
Since open ears are not visible like open eyes or an open mouth how can you show your mate you are truly listening ?	Esiane sɛ wontumi nhu aso a emu abue te sɛ aniwa anaa ano a wɔabue mu nti ɔkwan bɛn so na wubetumi akyerɛ wo hokafo sɛ woretie no ankasa ?
One way is by mirroring or active listening

Openness and intimacy Our culture works against openness notes the book One to One Understanding Personal Relationships
Atirimsɛm a wɔda no adi pefee Nhoma One to One Understanding Personal Relationships ka sɛ Yɛn amammerɛ tia nneɛma a wɔda no adi
We are taught from an early age to mind our own business to be secretive about money ideas feelings

This lesson does not simply go away even when we fall in love
Saa asɛm yi mfi yɛn tirim mpofirim sɛ yenya ɔdɔ ma obi mpo a
’
Unless a continuing struggle for openness takes place intimacy cannot flourish
Sɛ yɛankɔ so ammɔ mmɔden sɛ yɛbɛda nneɛma adi pefee a nkitahodi pa ntumi nnya nkɔso
There is a frustrating of plans where there is no confidential talk observes Proverbs but with those consulting together there is wisdom
Proverbs

Loyalty and trust Husband and wife vow before God to be loyal
Nokwaredi ne Ahotoso Okunu ne ɔyere ka ntam wɔ Onyankopɔn anim sɛ wobedi nokware
When marriage partners trust that each is loyally committed to the other love is unencumbered by suspicion pride spirit of competition preoccupation with getting one s fair share

Sharing A relationship deepens with shared experiences

In time a couple can weave a priceless tapestry of history that each cherishes
Bere a bere kɔ so no awarefo betumi anya abusuabɔ bi a ɛsom bo a wɔn baanu nyinaa ani begye ho
To consider tearing apart that bond of friendship is the furthest thing from their minds
Ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wobesusuw sɛ wɔbɛtete wɔn adamfofa no mu
There exists a friend sticking closer than a brother

Kindness and tenderness Kind acts reduce life s frictions and dilute pride
Ayamye ne brɛbrɛyɛ Nneɛma a wofi ayamye mu yɛ tew asetram ntawntawdi so na ɛbrɛ ahantan ase
Patterns of kindness if ingrained remain intact even if emotions run high during disagreements thus minimizing damage
Sɛ ayamye su wɔ obi mu a ɛkɔ so da adi bere a abufuw mu yɛ den wɔ akasakasa mu mpo na ɛmma nneɛma nsɛe kɛse
Tenderness creates a warm climate in which love can grow
Brɛbrɛyɛ de tebea horow a anigye wom a ɛma ɔdɔ tumi nya nkɔso ba
Though gentleness may be especially difficult for a man to express the Bible says The desirable thing in earthling man is his loving kindness
Ɛwom sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ den titiriw ama ɔbarima sɛ ɔbɛda odwo adi de nanso Bible ka sɛ Onipa adɔeyɛ ne n’ade a eye
As for a good wife the law of loving kindness is upon her tongue

Humility An antidote for the poison of pride humility prompts ready apologies and frequent expressions of thanks
Ahobrɛase Ahobrɛase ma yɛyɛ krado sɛ yɛbɛpa kyɛw na ɛtaa ma yɛda afoforo ase ma enti esiw ahantan kwan
What if you are truly innocent of a stated offense ?	Na sɛ wunnim biribi a wose woayɛ ho hwee nso ɛ ?
Why not gently say I m sorry you re so upset ?	Dɛn nti na wonka no brɛoo sɛ Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ woahaw saa ?
Manifest concern for your mate s sensitivities then together see how to correct the wrong
Ma wo hokafo nkate ho nhia wo na afei mo baanu mmom nhwehwɛ ɔkwan a mobɛfa so asiesie mfomso no
It is a glory for a man to desist from disputing
Proverbs

Respect The key word in recognizing each other s differences and working them out together is respect
Obu Ade titiriw a ɛma obi gye ne yɔnko nsusuwii a ɛne ne de nhyia tom na wɔbom di ho dwuma ne obu
What is important to one spouse may not be equally important to the other

Nevertheless each spouse can always respect the other s views

Giving Launch a happy hunt for things to appreciate about your mate and give compliments generously
Adekyɛ Fa adwempa hwehwɛ wo hokafo no ho nneɛma a ɛbɛma woanya ne ho anisɔ na fi ayamye mu kamfo no
These coveted items may bring a greater heart response than a silk tie or a bouquet of flowers
Ebia ne koma ani begye saa nneɛma yi ho asen paanoo anaa pawda a wobɛtɔ abɛkyɛ no
Of course you can still buy or do nice things for each other

If these qualities could be compared to building blocks of the marital relationship then communication is the mortar needed to cement them together
Sɛ wobetumi de saa su ahorow yi atoto blɔks a wɔde hyehyɛ aware abusuabɔ no ho a ɛnde na nkɔmmɔbɔ ne mɔɔta a ehia na wɔde aka abom
So what can couples do when disagreements arise ?	Enti sɛ akasakasa sɔre a dɛn na awarefo betumi ayɛ ?
 Instead of seeing your partner s differing views as a source of conflict
find them a source of knowledge
Nhoma Getting the Love You Want ka sɛ Sɛ anka wubebu wo hokafo nsusuwii ahorow a ɛne wo de nhyia no sɛ biribi a ɛde ntawntawdi ba no

The details of everyday life become a gold mine of information says the book Getting the Love You Want
Da biara da mu nsɛm bɛyɛ asuade a ɛsom bo ama wo
See every occasion of disagreement then not as a call to arms but as a precious opportunity to gain insight into this one you love
Ɛnde bu akasakasa biara a ɛba sɛ hokwan a ɛsom bo a wuhia na woanya onii a wodɔ no no ho nhumu na ɛnyɛ sɛ biribi a ɛtwetwe ntɔkwaw
Together accept the challenge to work out the difference and sail into the peaceful harbors of harmony thus strengthening the bonds deepening the love that makes the two of you one
Mo nyinaa monnye ntom na munni su horow a enhyia ho dwuma na ɛmfa asomdwoe mmrɛ mo na ɛnhyɛ mo biakoyɛ ne mo dɔ a ɛma mo baanu ka bom yɛ biako no mu den
Jehovah God sees great beauty in cooperation and so built it into his creation in the give and take oxygen cycle of plants and animals the orbits of heavenly bodies the symbiotic relationships between insects and flowers
Yehowa Nyankopɔn hu fɛ a biakoyɛ yɛ na ɔde hyɛɛ n’adebɔ mu wɔ mframa a mmoa home ma afifide na afifide nso de ma mmoa twa a wim abɔde twa ebi ho hyia nkoekoemmoa ne nhwiren ntam abusuabɔ a nneɛma abien no nyinaa nya mu mfaso mu
So too in the marital union there can exist a warm cycle in which a husband in word and in deed reassures his wife of his love and a trusting loving wife contentedly follows his lead
Saa ara nso na wɔ aware nkabom mu no adeyɛ a ɛte saa a anigye wom betumi atra mu na okunu nam nsɛm a ɔka ne nneyɛe so ama ne yere anya ne dɔ mu awerɛhyem na ɔyere nokwafo a ɔwɔ ɔdɔ de akomatɔyam adi n’akanni akyi
Thus the two really do become one bringing joy to each other and to the Originator of marriage Jehovah God

 Pay Attention to How You Listen
Luke 	 Monhwɛ Yiye Sɛnea Mote Asɛm no Fa
Luka 
Active listening is a method of ensuring that speaker and listener truly understand each other
Aso a wɔyɛ de tie asɛm ne ɔkwan a wɔnam so hu sɛ ɔkasafo ne otiefo no te wɔn ho ase ankasa
It is sometimes called mirroring since the listener attempts to reflect the words he hears and the meaning he perceives
Ɛtɔ da bi a egye sɛ wɔhwɛ wɔn ho anim efisɛ otiefo no bɔ mmɔden sɛ obesusuw nsɛm a ɔte no ne ntease a ɛwom no ho
These are the basic steps 	Eyinom ne akwan atitiriw a wɔnam so tie asɛm 
Pay careful attention listen for important messages
Wɛn w’aso yiye tie na woahu nsɛm a ɛho hia
Listen for feelings underlying the words
Tie na hu nkate a ɛwɔ nsɛm a ɔka no akyi
Repeat to the speaker what you hear
Ti nea wote no mu kyerɛ ɔkasafo no
Don t judge criticize or dispute
Mmu no fɔ nkasa ntia no anaasɛ ɛne no nham
Just let the person know you have correctly received the message
Ma onipa no nhu sɛ woate nea waka no yiye
Acknowledge the feelings
Gye nkate a ɔda no adi no tom
The speaker will probably either confirm or correct what you say and may perhaps expand on the subject further
Ebia ɔkasafo no besi nea woka no so dua anaasɛ ɔbɛteɛ no na ebia ɔbɛkyerɛkyerɛ mu akɔ akyiri
If your understanding is inaccurate try again
Sɛ wonte ase yiye a bisa no bio
Active listening is especially effective in reducing the sting of criticism
Aso a wɔyɛ de tie asɛm tumi tew ɔkasatia mu yaw so titiriw
Accept the fact that criticism is often based on some truth
Gye tom sɛ ɔkasatia taa gyina nokwasɛm bi so
It might be delivered in a painful way but instead of defensively heaving the pain back on the critic why not use active listening to defuse the situation ?	Ebia ɔbɛka no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ yaw so nanso sɛ anka wobɛsosɔ so ako atia ɔkasatiafo no dɛn nti na womfa aso a wowɛn de tie asɛm no nni dwuma nnwudwo tebea no ano ?
Acknowledge that you understand whatever upset feelings you may be held responsible for and see how the matter can be rectified

 If Anyone Has a Cause for Complaint
Colossians 	 Sɛ Obi ne Obi Nya Asɛm Bi A
Kolosefo 
When you have a complaint how can you best deliver it without starting a war ?	Sɛ wowɔ asɛm bi ka a ɔkwan bɛn so na wubetumi ada no adi yiye a wumfi ntɔkwaw ase ?
First give your mate credit for being well intentioned
Nea edi kan no kamfo wo hokafo no wɔ n’adwempa a ɔwɔ ho
You might feel he or she was inconsiderate thoughtless brash unwise but overall it is likely that no harm was meant
Ebia wote nka sɛ wannya tema amma wo wansusuw wo ho wanyɛ anifere anaa wamfa nyansa anni dwuma nanso ne nyinaa mu no ɛda adi sɛ na onni adwene bi sɛ obepira wo
Calmly state your feelings without accusation When you did this then I felt
Da wo nkate adi wɔ odwo kwan so a wommɔ no sobo sɛ Bere a woyɛɛ eyi no metee nka sɛ
No fuel for dispute here
Nea ɛde akasakasa ba biara nni eyi mu
It simply states how you feel and does not accuse your mate
Ɛkyerɛ sɛnea wote nka ara kwa na ɛmmɔ wo hokafo no sobo
Since the person may never have intended to upset you at all the reaction may be denial or self justification
Esiane sɛ ebia na ɛnyɛ onipa no adwene ne sɛ ɔreyɛ biribi ma ahaw wo no nti ebia obegye nea woka no ho kyim anaasɛ obebu ne ho bem
Focus on the problem though and be ready to propose a solution
Nanso fa w’adwene si ɔhaw no so na yɛ krado sɛ wode nsusuwii bi a mubetumi de adi nneɛma ho dwuma bɛma

How Can I Break Free From a Double Life ?	Mɛyɛ Dɛn Atumi Akwati Asetra Akwan Abien ?
 I disregarded everything my parents said confesses Ann
Ann ka sɛ Na mimmu biribiara a m’awofo ka
I was rebellious and started lying to them

NA ANN nam asetra akwan abien so ankyɛ na ofii ase buu n’ani guu n’awofo kasakyerɛ ne n’ahonim a na ɔde Bible atete no nso so
Ann you see was secretly having sex relations with her boyfriend

She recalls I tried to push Jehovah out of my mind altogether
Ɔka sɛ Mebɔɔ mmɔden sɛ mɛma me werɛ afi Yehowa koraa
Nevertheless she soon ran smack into the sobering piece of reality that whatever persons are sowing this they will also reap
Nanso ankyɛ na ohyiaa nokwasɛm a anibere wom yi sɛ nea nnipa gu biara no ɛno ara na wobetwa

Have you in some way become trapped in a double life hiding what you are from your parents and fellow Christians ?	So asetra akwan abien asum wo afiri kyerɛ sɛ wode sɛnea wote ankasa sie w’awofo ne wo mfɛfo Kristofo ?
Perhaps you are simply hanging out with some school friends whom you know your parents would disapprove of
Ebia nea woyɛ ara ne sɛ wone wo sukuufo nnamfo bi a wunim sɛ w’awofo ani rennye ho sɛ wone wɔn bɛbɔ fekuw rebɔ
Or maybe you have fallen into more serious misconduct such as smoking alcohol abuse or premarital sex
Anaasɛ ebia wode wo ho ahyɛ nneyɛe bɔne bi a anibere wom mu te sɛ sigaretnom mmosa a wɔnom tra so anaa ɔbarima ne ɔbea nna a edi aware anim mu
In any event as with Ann it is just a matter of time before serious consequences result
Sɛnea na ɛte wɔ Ann fam no ɛnkyɛ na woatwa so aba
Even so some youths don t let this fact deter them at all from their rebellious course
Nokwasɛm yi mpo mmɔ mmofra bi hu koraa mma wɔntwe wɔn ho mfi wɔn atuatew kwan a wɔnam so no so
They are like the man who looks at himself in the mirror and immediately forgets what sort of man he is

It is our hope that you are of a different sort
Yɛwɔ awerɛhyem sɛ wode wonte saa
Perhaps you have already begun taking a long hard look at yourself and don t like what you see
Ebia woafi ase dedaw rehwehwɛ wo ho mu yiye na w’ani nnye nea wuhu no ho
You want to change
Wopɛ sɛ wosakra
You see the need to change
Wuhu hia a ɛho hia sɛ wosakra
The question is how do you change ?	Asɛm no ne sɛ ɔkwan bɛn na wubetumi afa so asakra ?
Repentance The First Step	Adwensakra Adeyɛ a Edi Kan
First you must make a conscious decision to change
Nea edi kan ɛsɛ sɛ wusi gyinae sɛ wobɛsakra
Acts urges Repent therefore and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah
Asomafo no Nnwuma hyɛ yɛn sɛ Enti monsakra mo adwene na monnan mo ho na wɔapopa mo bɔne na ɛyɛ a ahodwo nna afi Yehowa anim aba
Repentance however is more than a feat of intellect
Nanso adwensakra sen biribi a adwene tumi yɛ ara kwa
To repent means to feel regret contrition or compunction for what one has done
Sɛ obi bɛsakra no kyerɛ sɛ obedi yaw anu ne ho anaa n’ahonim bebu no fɔ wɔ nea wayɛ ho
The Bible writer James exhorted Give way to misery and mourn and weep
Bible kyerɛwfo Yakobo tuu fo sɛ Munni nkɔmmɔ na mo werɛ nhow na munsu !
Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection
Mo serew nnan awerɛhow na mo anigye nnan anito !
Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah
Mommrɛ mo ho ase Yehowa anim
How can you feel bad about something you have enjoyed up till now ?	Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na woatumi adi yaw wɔ biribi a woanya mu anigye de besi nnɛ ho ?
Think about how wrong it is
Susuw bɔne a ɛyɛ no ho
Think about how it has hurt God
Susuw sɛnea ahaw Onyankopɔn no ho
Think of the problems your hidden course has caused you and the lies you have had to tell to conceal it
Susuw nsɛnnennen a wo kokoam asetra no de aba wo so ne atoro a ama woadi na wode akata so no ho
Remind yourself that God detests the practice of deception !	Kae sɛ Onyankopɔn kyi nnaadaa !
Meditating on these facts can help you reject wrong conduct both intellectually and emotionally
Nokwasɛm ahorow yi a wubesusuw ho betumi aboa wo ma wode w’adwene ne wo nkate nyinaa apow nnebɔne
Simply feeling bad about what you are doing is not enough though

A young man named Robert who got involved in a secret practice of drug abuse admits I was miserable
Aberante bi a wɔfrɛ no Robert a na ɔde nnuru di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so gye tom sɛ Na midi awerɛhow

Still I continued leading a double life

Courageous action is thus needed !	Enti ade a wɔyɛ no akokoduru so ho hia !
At Chronicles God said that if sinners would humble themselves and pray and seek his face and turn back from their bad ways then he himself would hear from the heavens and forgive their sin
Wɔ Beresosɛm no Onyankopɔn kae sɛ sɛ abɔnefo bɛbrɛ wɔn ho ase na wɔabɔ mpae na wɔahwehwɛ n’anim na wɔasan afi wɔn kwammɔne no so a ɛnde ɔno ankasa fi soro betie na ɔde wɔn bɔne afiri wɔn

Nea Onyankopɔn anim a wɔhwehwɛ ’ kyerɛ ne sɛ wobɛkɔ n’anim wɔ mpaebɔ mu aka wo bɔne akyerɛ no na woasrɛ bɔne fafiri
This may not be easy to do but you will no doubt feel greatly relieved for having done so

Yes when the initial shock and anger wear off most parents try to be supportive
Yiw sɛ wɔn ahodwiriw ne abufuw a wonya mfiase no ano dwudwo a awofo bebree bɔ mmɔden de mmoa ma
How much more so is this true when parents are God fearing !	Na hwɛ sɛnea eyi yɛ nokware bere a awofo no yɛ nkurɔfo a wosuro Onyankopɔn no !
Their main concern should be not to shame or hurt you but to set matters straight

True there will be some well deserved punishment from your parents to endure and perhaps some tighter restrictions

But this can actually help you to avoid falling back into your old ways
Nanso eyi betumi aboa w’ankasa ma woakwati sɛ wobɛsan akɔfa w’akwan dedaw no so

Work in harmony with this prayer by telling your old associates that you have changed and are determined to do what is right
Yɛ biribi a ɛne mpaebɔ yi hyia denam wo nnamfo dedaw no a wobɛka akyerɛ wɔn sɛ woasakra na woasi wo bo sɛ wobɛyɛ nea ɛteɛ no so

Riding together on one bicycle as so many do in this country we had just a short journey to make to visit a fellow Witness

As the doctors gave up hope of saving Henry they turned their undivided attention to me
Esiane sɛ na nnuruyɛfo nni anidaso bio sɛ wobetumi agye Henry nkwa nti wɔde wɔn ani sii me nkutoo so
Weak as I was the urgent need to advise them of my determination to respect Jehovah s law to abstain from blood filled my heart

I gathered what little strength I had to speak A piece of paper please
Mede ahoɔden kakra a mewɔ no kasae Mesrɛ mo momma me krataa bi nkyerɛw so
I laboriously wrote my convictions down and signed the paper
Mebɔɔ mmɔden kyerɛw me gyidi wɔ krataa no so na mede me nsa hyɛɛ ase
And then the fight began
Na ɛhɔ na ɔko no fii ase
I was given first aid
Wɔyɛɛ me aduru kakra de twɛn ayaresa no ankasa
It was only too obvious that I was very seriously injured
Na ɛda adi yiye sɛ mapira kɛse
My determination to act as a true Christian filled my every fiber this was not yet the time to grieve
Saa bere no na nea agye m’adwene nyinaa ne me bo a masi sɛ mɛyɛ ade te sɛ nokware Kristoni na eyi nyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ midi awerɛhow
They Refused to Operate Without Blood	Wɔampene so sɛ Wɔbɛyɛ Me Oprehyɛn a Wɔmma me Mogya
For nine days the battle regarding a blood transfusion continued my fight to live in harmony with my conscience by refusing it the doctors fight to convince me to accept it
Mogya a wɔde ma ho ɔko kɔɔ so nna akron meko de powee sɛ megye mogya na matumi atra ase ma ɛne m’ahonim ahyia na nnuruyɛfo no koe sɛ wɔbɛdan m’adwene ma magye mogya
Although they had the skills they simply refused to operate without blood
Ɛwom sɛ na wɔn ho akokwaw de nanso pow ara na wɔpowee sɛ wɔbɛyɛ me oprehyɛn no a wɔmma me mogya
The wound was a major one and needed their immediate attention
Na mapira kɛse paa a ehia sɛ wɔhwɛ me ntɛm
But I did not have to fight the battle alone
Nanso ɛnyɛ me nko na midii ako no
Jehovah was with me every moment

And the brotherhood of Jehovah s people was full of loving concern
Na na Yehowa nkurɔfo fi onuadɔ mu nso dwen me ho kɛse
Colombo was miles away

Perrin Jayasekera one of Jehovah s Witnesses arranged for his fleshly brother a surgeon there to admit me to Colombo General Hospital

Yet my heart was filled with gratitude to Jehovah for his loving care just as it had been ever since I first learned the truth in my native country India
Nanso minyaa Yehowa ho anisɔ kɛse wɔ me koma mu esiane sɛnea ofi ɔdɔ mu hwɛɛ me te sɛ nea na wayɛ fi bere a mihuu nokware no foforo wɔ me man India mu no nti

That part of India has a large population of people claiming to be Christian

Challenging Decisions to Make	Gyinae Ahorow a ne Si Yɛ Den
When my family began to learn the enlightening truths from the Bible with the help of Jehovah s Witnesses my natural desire was to share this truth with those professing Christianity in my community
Bere a Yehowa Adansefo boaa m’abusua no ma yesuaa Bible mu nokware ahorow a ɛma nhumu no mifi komam nyaa ɔpɛ sɛ me ne wɔn a wɔte me mpɔtam hɔ a wɔkyerɛ sɛ wɔyɛ Kristofo no bɛbɔ nokware yi ho nkɔmmɔ
So I became a pioneer a full time minister shortly after my dedication and baptism
Enti mihyiraa me ho so gyee asubɔ akyi no ankyɛ na mebɛyɛɛ ɔkwampaefo anaa bere nyinaa ɔsomfo
This meant rejecting the offer of an excellent position as a teacher in my home State
Eyi ma mepow hokwan a minyae sɛ anka menya dibea kɛse sɛ ɔkyerɛkyerɛfo wɔ ɔmampɔn a na mete mu no mu
Having the apparent security that such a pensionable position gives is the goal of many young Indians but my purpose in life had changed
Indiafo mmofra pii botae ne sɛ wobenya adwuma a ɛte sɛ nea ahobammɔ wom a sɛ wonyin ma wogyae adwuma mpo a wobetua wɔn ka nanso na m’asetra mu atirimpɔw asakra
I wanted real security and that could be found only under Jehovah s protective hand
Na mehwehwɛ ahobammɔ ankasa na na Yehowa hɔ nkutoo na me nsa betumi aka
Two years later a new challenge
Asɛnnennen foforo sɔree mfe abien akyi
Would I be willing to move to another part of India to help where there was a greater need for preachers ?	So na menya ɔpɛ sɛ metu akɔtra India kurow foforo mu akɔboa wɔ faako a wohia asɛnkafo wɔ hɔ kɛse ?
It posed the challenge of learning a new language Tamil and helping people from a very different religious background this time Hindu
Asɛnnennen a na ɛwom ne sɛ mesua kasa foforo Tamil na maboa nnipa a wɔwɔ ɔsom soronko koraa mu afei Hindufo
Yes the opportunity to demonstrate my appreciation to Jehovah made all the changes worthwhile
Yiw hokwan a minyae sɛ mɛda Yehowa ho anisɔ a mewɔ adi no maa nsakrae no nyinaa yɛɛ nea ɛfata
Witnessing to those warm friendly people from a Hindu background was a joy indeed
Na Hindufo a wɔwɔ ɔdɔ na wɔpɛ nnipa no a midii wɔn adanse no yɛ anigye ankasa
They could easily accept that we are nearing the end of Kali Yuga the Wicked Age and that something far better lies just ahead for those acting righteously now

However helping them see the difference between true Christianity and what they had experienced from the West was a great challenge
Nanso na ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ wɔbɛboa wɔn ma wɔahu nsonsonoe a ɛda nokware Kristosom ne nea wɔasua afi Atɔe Famfo hɔ no ntam
How often I opened my Bible to Matthew Not everyone saying to me Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of the heavens but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will

Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and expel demons in your name and perform many powerful works in your name ? 	Ɛda no nnipa pii bɛka akyerɛ me sɛ Awurade Awurade yɛmfaa wo din nhyɛɛ nkɔm na yɛmfaa wo din ntuu ahonhommɔne na yɛmfaa wo din nyɛɛ ahoɔdenne pii anaa ?
And yet then I will confess to them I never knew you ! Get away from me you workers of lawlessness

Mohandas Gandhi had said it well I love Christ but I despise Christians because they do not live as Christ lived
Na Mohandas Ghandi aka no yiye sɛ Medɔ Kristo nanso mimmu Kristofo efisɛ wɔntra ase sɛnea Kristo traa ase no
’
Many Hindus are finding just as I had found that there is a lot of truth in that statement
Sɛnea na mahu no Hindufo pii rehu sɛ saa asɛm no yɛ nokware paara
And now they also observe that many of their fellow Hindus act little differently from those from the West who hypocritically profess Christianity
Na mprempren wohu nso sɛ wɔn mfɛfo Hindufo pii yɛ wɔn ade te sɛ Atɔe Famfo a wofi nyaatwomyɛ mu kyerɛ sɛ wɔyɛ Kristofo no pɛpɛɛpɛ

Both of us were looking for someone with whom to share our lives of devotion to Jehovah

Five months later we married
Asram anum akyi no yɛwaree
He had been trained at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead in New York State and then sent back to his native land Sri Lanka where the need was very great

I hoped he would be willing to move to India where I felt the need was even greater
Na m’anidaso ne sɛ obenya ɔpɛ sɛ obetu aba India efisɛ na misusuw sɛ mmoa ho hia wɔ hɔ sen Sri Lanka
But that was not to be
Nanso amma saa
He was needed where he was
Na wohia no wɔ faako a ɔwɔ no
So my home became this lovely island of Sri Lanka
Enti mitu kɔtraa Sri Lanka supɔw fɛfɛ yi so
Happily Tamil and English are very useful here
Nea na ɛyɛ anigye no wɔka Tamil ne Engiresi kasa wɔ ha paa
So I did not have to learn another language then
Enti na enhia sɛ misua kasa foforo saa bere no
We enjoyed happy years together in Jehovah s service before tragedy struck in the form of the speeding truck
Yɛboom nyaa Yehowa som mu anigye mfe kosi sɛ asiane a ɛne lɔre a na ɛde mmirika no bɛtoo yɛn
But now I was in Colombo and my fight to live without compromising my integrity by blood transfusion continued
Nanso na mewɔ Colombo afei na mekɔɔ so koe na amma mannyae me mudi mu kura denam mogya a megye no so
Now my life was in jeopardy not because of my stand on blood but because of the delay in treatment
Saa bere yi na me nkwa da asiane mu a ɛnyɛ gyinae a misii sɛ minnye mogya no nti na mmom esiane sɛ na wɔmma me ayaresa ntɛm nti
A plastic surgeon with a Buddhist background and an orthopedic surgeon with a Hindu background joined to offer their skills in my behalf
Oduruyɛfo bi a ɔyɛ nipadua akwaa ho oprehyɛn a ɔyɛ Buddhani ne oduruyɛfo bi a ɔyɛ nnompe ho oprehyɛn a ɔyɛ Hinduni kaa wɔn tiri boom sɛ wɔde wɔn ahokokwaw no bedi aboa me
My blood count hemoglobin was now down to about four
Na me mogya hemoglobin adu bɛyɛ anan
How to amputate at the thigh with so little blood ?	Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na wɔatwa obi a ne mogya so atew saa nan wɔ ne srɛ mu ?
My determination was clear but would these two surgeons be willing to give me the assistance I had previously been refused ?	Na mada me gyinaesi no adi pefee nanso so nnuruyɛfo baanu yi de mmoa a ebinom adi kan de akame me no bɛma me ?
Their courage in accepting this tremendous challenge without trying to force me to compromise my conscience was outstanding
Akokoduru a wonyae sɛ wobedi ɔhaw kɛse yi ho dwuma a wɔammɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛhyɛ me ma mabu m’ani agu m’ahonim so no da nsow
I lost my leg but my life was saved and my integrity to Jehovah was intact
Wotwaa me nan nanso wogyee me nkwa na mekɔɔ so kuraa me mudi mu maa Yehowa
Without the husband I loved so much a totally new chapter in my life was now opening
Esiane sɛ me kunu a medɔ no no fii mu no nti na afei merefi asetra foforo koraa ase
First with crutches then with a prosthesis later through the kindness of many brothers and sisters replaced by a much improved artificial leg I was able to continue in my ministry

Learning to help these people has become very important to me
Ɔkwan a mɛfa so aboa saa nkurɔfo yi ayɛ me ahiasɛm kɛse
Much like the Hindus in India and throughout Sri Lanka Buddhists have been turned away from the Bible by the conduct of the so called Christians of the West
Te sɛ Hindufo a wɔwɔ India ne Sri Lanka nyinaa no Atɔe Famfo a wose wɔyɛ Kristofo no suban ama Buddhafo apow Bible no
Yet their basic Buddhist principles the famous Eightfold Path of right thought and right conduct right belief intention speech action living endeavor thought meditation are but imperfect human wisdom compared to the divine principles found in the Bible most of which was written centuries prior to Siddhartha Gautama
Nanso sɛ wɔde wɔn Budhhasom mu nnyinasosɛm atitiriw a wɔfrɛ no Akwan Awotwe a ɛfa nsusuwii ne abrabɔ a ɛteɛ ho a agye din gyidi adwene kasa nneyɛe asetra dwumadi nsusuwii ne nsɛm ho a wodwen a ɛfata no toto Bible a wɔkyerɛw emu dodow no ara mfehaha pii ansa na Siddhartha Gautama reba no mu ɔsoro nnyinasosɛm no ho a na akwan awotwe no yɛ nnipa a wɔtɔ sin nyansa ara kwa
When Siddhartha Gautama spoke to the Kalamas as quoted in the Kalama Sutta he said Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing nor upon tradition
Bere a Siddhartha Gautama ne Kalamafo no rekasa no ɔkaa nea ɛwɔ Kalama Sutta no mu sɛ Monnnye atesɛm nnni na monnnye atetesɛm nso nnni
How very strange that I should have the privilege of reminding many sincere Buddhists that if that guidance is applied today no one could believe the myth of evolution or deny the existence of a Creator

The End of Wickedness Is Near	Amumɔyɛ Awiei Abɛn
Jehovah s Witnesses have many good things from the Bible to tell these people about the kalpa vinasha the end of wickedness that is so near
Nsɛmpa pii wɔ Bible no mu a Yehowa Adansefo betumi aka akyerɛ saa nkurɔfo yi ɛdefa kalpa vinasha amumɔyɛ awiei a abɛn kɛse no ho
The Bible s year old prophecy on this is found at Timothy
Eyi ho nkɔm a Bible no hyɛe bɛyɛ mfe ni no wɔ Timoteo
We also have the privilege of showing them that the place to look for preservation through these times is not the religions of the West or the East but as Ti verses and of that same chapter show Jehovah s own inspired Word the Bible
Yenya hokwan no nso sɛ yɛbɛkyerɛ wɔn sɛ ɛnyɛ Atɔe Fam anaa Apuei Fam som ahorow no na ɛbɛma wɔakora obi so wɔ saa mmere yi mu na mmom sɛnea saa ti no ara nkyekyem ne kyerɛ no Yehowa ankasa Asɛm a ɔnam honhom so ma wɔkyerɛwee Bible no so
Buddhism is a search for enlightenment
Buddhasom yɛ nhumu a wɔhwehwɛ
In the Bible long before Siddhartha Gautama began his own search the true cause of suffering was clearly explained
Bere tenten ansa na Siddhartha Gautama refi n’ankasa nhwehwɛmu ase no na wɔakyerɛkyerɛ nea ama amanehunu aba mu pefee wɔ Bible no mu
Rebellion against righteous law right at the beginning of human history brought unhappy results sickness and death which spread inevitably to all human sinners
Atua a wɔtew tiaa trenee mmara wɔ nnipa abakɔsɛm mfiase pɛɛ no kowiee awerɛhow mu ɔyare ne owu a ɛtrɛw kaa nnipa abɔnefo nyinaa a wontumi nyɛ ho hwee
Troubling questions come up in the minds of many as at Habakkuk Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful and you keep looking upon mere trouble ?	Nsemmisa a ɛhaw adwene ba nnipa pii adwene mu te sɛ nea ɛwɔ Habakuk no Ɛdɛn nti na woma mihu abusude na wohwɛ ɔhaw yi ?
And why are despoiling and violence in front of me and why does quarreling occur and why is strife carried ? 	Ɔsɛe ne nhyɛso da m’anim na ɔham ba na akameakame sɔre
Only the compassionate Creator can supply the answers and design a means of restoring permanently that which was lost
Ɔbɔadeɛ mmɔborohunufo no nkutoo na obetumi abua nsemmisa no na wafa ɔkwan bi so ama nnipa nsa aka nea wɔahwere no daa
Even now millions worldwide are benefiting from the practical wisdom of God s Word
Ɛnnɛ mpo nnipa ɔpepem pii a wɔwɔ wiase nyinaa renya Onyankopɔn Asɛm no mu nyansa a eye no mu mfaso
And so now Sinhalese the major language of this country has become another challenge for me for in that language I can help those earnestly searching for the enlightenment I found years ago
Enti mprempren Sinhalese a ɛyɛ kasa titiriw a wɔka wɔ ɔman yi mu no abɛyɛ asɛnnennen foforo ama me efisɛ saa kasa no na metumi de aboa wɔn a wofi komam hwehwɛ nhumu a minyaa no mfe a atwam no
Still another challenge

My years of full time service to Jehovah have been but a moment in what I hope will be an eternity of serving him
Mede mfe a mede ayɛ bere nyinaa Yehowa ɔsomfo no toto anidaso a mewɔ sɛ mɛsom no daa no ho a esua koraa
Many have joined us in Jehovah s service during these years including the skilled surgeon who arranged both for my admittance to the hospital in Colombo and for the necessary surgery
Nnipa pii abɛka yɛn ho wɔ saa mfe yi mu a oduruyɛfo a ne ho akokwaw a ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe maa wogyee me too ayaresabea a ɛwɔ Colombo hɔ ma wɔyɛɛ me oprehyɛn a na mihia no nso ka ho
Now he also is a fellow dedicated Witness of Jehovah
Mprempren ɔyɛ me yɔnko Yehowa Dansefo a wahyira ne ho so
Jehovah and his family of servants on earth have sustained me so very well
Yehowa ne n’asase so abusuafo a wɔyɛ n’asomfo awowaw me pii
I have felt his protective arms enveloping me and I know his loyal love holds Henry fast in memory
Mate n’ahobammɔ nka wɔ me so kɛse na minim sɛ n’adɔe nti ɔkae Henry yiye
Only Jehovah can bring my beloved one back from the dust to allow me to greet him once more to tell Henry of all the thrilling challenges our generation has brought and how Jehovah has helped us meet them

 I WAS up day and night but I still felt that it was a privilege

That was how one woman described caring for her elderly mother

For this woman and many others caring for aging parents is a positive experience
Wɔ saa ɔbea yi ne afoforo pii fam no awofo a wɔn mfe rekɔ anim a wɔhwɛ wɔn no yɛ osuahu a ɛyɛ anigye
It is also becoming a more common experience

The fastest growing age group in the United States is said to be the plus category

Older people are living longer and about a third of those or older need regular assistance

While caregiving can be a rewarding experience it is not without stress
Ɛmfa ho sɛ obi a ne mfe kɔ anim a wɔhwɛ no betumi ayɛ osuahu a mfaso wɔ so no ɔhaw nso wom
If one or both of your parents are aged and in need of your care you may find certain aspects difficult
Sɛ w’awofo mu biako anaa wɔn baanu nyinaa mfe kɔ anim na sɛ wohia wo hwɛ a nneɛma bi yɛ betumi ayɛ wo den
Just watching them decline in health surely causes you pain
Hu a wubehu kɛkɛ sɛ wɔkɔ so gow no ma wudi yaw ankasa
And if you receive little or no help from other family members then you are left with the bulk of the caregiving
Na sɛ abusuafo afoforo ammoa wo pii anaa wɔammoa wo koraa a ɛnde na wo na wobɛyɛ ɔhwɛ adwuma no mu fa kɛse no ara
You may also discover that no matter how old you are you never feel grown up around your parents
Ebetumi aba sɛ bere a wowɔ w’awofo nkyɛn no ɛmfa ho mfe a woadi no wonte nka da sɛ woanyin
Their tendency may be to treat you like a child and your tendency may be to respond like one
Ebia wɔne wo bedi te sɛ abofra na wo nso woayɛ wo ho saa
Lack of emotional support from friends can add a stressful element to your caregiving
Sɛ woannya nkuranhyɛ amfi wo nnamfo hɔ a ebetumi de ɔhyɛ no bi aka ɔhwɛ a wode ma no ho
Nevertheless the challenges of caregiving need not interfere with your maintaining a close relationship with your parents
Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔhwɛ a wode ma no mu ɔhaw ahorow no sɛe abusuabɔ pa a wobɛma atra wo ne w’awofo ntam no
The Scriptures clearly direct adults to practice godly devotion in their own household and to keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents for this is acceptable in God s sight
Kyerɛwnsɛm no kyerɛ wɔn a wɔanyinyin pefee sɛ wonsua onyamesom pa wɔn fi mu kan ntua wɔn awofo ka efisɛ eyi na eye na ɛsɔ Onyankopɔn ani
On the other hand he that chases a mother away is a son acting shamefully and disgracefully
Timothy Proverbs
Ɔkwan foforo so no nea ɔpam ne na no yɛ aniwu ne ahohora ba
Timoteo Mmebusɛm
Godly devotion expressed through caregiving can be an enriching experience
Onyamesom pa a wɔnam ɔhwɛ so de ma betumi ayɛ osuahu a mfaso wɔ so
But first you must know what your parents actually need from you in the way of help

Nsɛm a edidi eyi so no betumi aboa wo ma woahu saa ahiade ahorow no adi ho dwuma
And while these articles focus on what can be done in the home it is understood that in some cases because of very poor health or advanced age a parent may require professional help such as that found in a nursing home

Assessing Your Parents Needs	W’awofo Ahiade Ahorow A Wubesusuw Ho
TO BE of true help to your aging parents you must learn what their needs and preferences are
NEA ɛbɛyɛ na woatumi aboa w’awofo a wɔn mfe akɔ anim no ankasa no ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu wɔn ahiade ahorow ne nneɛma a wɔpɛ
Otherwise you may with good intentions extend provisions and services that your parents do not need and do not want though they may be reluctant to tell you that
Anyɛ saa a wubetumi afi adwempa mu de nneɛma ne mmoa a w’awofo nhia anaa wɔmpɛ ama wɔn ɛwom sɛ wɔrempɛ sɛ wɔbɛka akyerɛ wo de
Then your relationship based on misunderstandings would be unnecessarily stressful not only for you but for your parents as well
Sɛ ɛba saa a mo ntam abusuabɔ a ntease nnim no de ɔhaw a ɛnsɛ bɛbrɛ wo ne afei wɔn nso
What Do They Really Want ?	Dɛn na Wɔpɛ Ankasa ?
Believing that it will someday become necessary to move her parents in with her a woman arranges for that move right away
Ɔbea bi a na osusuw sɛ ɛho behia da bi sɛ ɔkɔfa n’awofo ba ne nkyɛn yɛ saa ntɛm ara
Later she discovers that her parents are quite capable of living in their own home and would be happier that way !	Akyiri yi ohui sɛ n’awofo betumi atra wɔn ankasa fie na wɔn ani begye ɛno ho mmom !
Having brought his parents in to live with him a son says You are not going to pay money to live in my house !	Ɔbabarima bi a ɔkɔfaa n’awofo bɛtraa ne nkyɛn ka sɛ Memma montua sika na moatra me fie !
Not after all you ve done for me ! 	Memma monnyɛ saa wɔ nea moayɛ ama me nyinaa akyi ! 
However this makes his parents feel overly dependent
Nanso eyi ma n’awofo te nka sɛ wɔdan no dodo
Eventually they tell him that they would prefer the dignity of contributing in some way
Awiei koraa no wɔka kyerɛ no sɛ wɔbɛpɛ sɛ ɔma wɔn hokwan ma wɔn nso wɔboa wɔ ɔkwan bi so
A family provides every minor service for their aging parents to ensure that they are comfortable and not burdened with physical exertion
Abusua bi yɛ biribiara ma wɔn awofo a wɔn mfe rekɔ anim de hwɛ hu sɛ wɔn ho tɔ wɔn na wɔmmrɛ wɔn ho
Later they discover that their parents want to do more for themselves
Akyiri yi wobehu sɛ wɔn awofo pɛ sɛ wɔn ankasa yɛ wɔn nneɛma pii
In each of the above examples the services performed were both unneeded and unwanted by the parents
Wɔ atifi hɔ nhwɛso ahorow yi biara mu no na awofo no nhia mmoa a wɔde maa wɔn no na afei nso na wɔmpɛ
This can easily happen if a well meaning son or daughter is motivated by an exaggerated sense of duty or if there is a lack of understanding as to the parents actual needs
Ɛnyɛ den sɛ eyi besi bere a ɔbabarima anaa ɔbabea a ɔwɔ adwempa bu n’asɛyɛde a ɔwɔ no kɛse dodo anaa bere a onnim nea n’awofo hia ankasa no
Think of the unnecessary stress this produces for all concerned
Susuw ɔhaw a ɛho nhia a eyi de brɛ wɔn nyinaa
The solution of course is to obtain an assessment of your parents actual needs and wants
Nokwarem no ano aduru ne sɛ wubehu w’awofo ahiade ahorow anaa nneɛma a wɔpɛ ankasa
Do your parents really need to move into your home at this point ?	So ehia sɛ w’awofo tu bɛtra wo fie mprempren ankasa ?
Do they even want to ?	So wɔwɔ ɔpɛ mpo sɛ wɔbɛyɛ saa ?
It may surprise you to learn that some older persons desire to live as independently as possible
Ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa sɛ wubehu sɛ wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim binom pɛ sɛ wɔtew wɔn ho sɛnea ebetumi ayɛ yiye biara
For fear of sounding unappreciative they may hesitate to express to their children that they would prefer to live by themselves in their own home despite some inconveniences
Ebia esiane sɛ wɔmpɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea wɔnkyerɛ anisɔ nti wɔrempɛ sɛ wɔbɛda no adi akyerɛ wɔn mma sɛ wɔpɛ sɛ wɔtra wɔn ara fie mu ɛmfa ho sɛ wobehyia ɔhaw ahorow bi no
They may love their children and long to spend time with them
Ebia na wɔdɔ wɔn mma na wɔn ani gye ho sɛ wɔbɛsrasra wɔn
But be dependent on their children ?	Nanso sɛ wɔn mma bɛhwɛ wɔn ?
No they may prefer to do things for themselves
Dabi wɔbɛpɛ sɛ wɔn ankasa yɛ wɔn nneɛma
Perhaps someday it will be necessary to move your parents into your home
Ebia da bi ɛho behia sɛ wokɔfa w’awofo bɛtra wo fie
However if that time has not yet arrived and if they honestly prefer to live by themselves why refuse them these years of independence ?	Nanso sɛ saa bere no nnui na sɛ wofi nokwaredi mu pɛ sɛ wɔn ankasa tra a dɛn nti na ɛnsɛ sɛ woma wɔn kwan ma wɔyɛ saa ?
Would some home adjustments or a regularly scheduled phone call or visit enable them to continue living in their own home ?	So nsakrae bi a wobɛyɛ ama wɔn wɔ wɔn fie anaasɛ sra a wobɛkɔ akɔsra wɔn anaa wone wɔn bɛkasa wɔ telefon so daa no bɛma wɔatumi akɔ so atra wɔn ankasa fie ?
They may feel happier in their own home making their own daily decisions
Ebia wɔn ani begye kɛse sɛ wɔte wɔn ankasa fie na da biara wɔn ankasa sisi wɔn gyinae ahorow
One caregiver explained her own haste in taking her mother in When my dad died we took my mother in feeling sorry for her
Ɔbea bi kaa sɛnea n’ankasa de ahopere kɔfaa ne maame bɛtraa ne fie ho asɛm Bere a me papa wui no ahummɔbɔ a yɛwɔ ma me maame maa yɛkɔfaa no baa yɛn fie
As it turned out she lived for more years
Sɛnea ɛkɔyɛe no ɔtraa ase mfe bio
Instead of selling her house she could have continued living in it
Sɛ anka yɛbɛtɔn ne fie no anka obetumi atra mu
Never be hasty in deciding what steps should be taken
Mpere wo ho nsi gyinae wɔ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho
A decision like that once made is hard to reverse
Compare Matthew
Sɛ wunya si gyinae a ɛte saa a ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛsakra no
Fa toto Mateo ho
But you may object what if something happened to one of my parents while living in their own home ?	Ebia wobɛpopo wo ti aka sɛ Na sɛ biribi yɛ m’awofo no mu biako bere a wɔte wɔn ankasa fie no nso ɛ ?
If Mom or Dad fell and got hurt I d never forgive myself ! 	Sɛ Maame anaa Paapa hwe ase na opira a m’ahonim bebu me fɔ ! ’
This is a valid concern especially if your parents strength or health has declined to the point that there is real danger of an accident
Sɛ eyi haw wo a ɛteɛ titiriw sɛ w’awofo ayɛ mmerɛw araa ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobehyia asiane a
If that is not the case though ask yourself whether your concern is for your parents or for yourself that is to protect yourself from inappropriate guilt
Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a bisa wo ho sɛ w’awofo na woredwen wɔn ho anaasɛ woredwen w’ankasa wo ho kyerɛ sɛ sɛ wobɛkwati afobu a ɛmfata nka a wobɛte nti
Consider too the possibility that your parents would be better off in their own home
Afei susuw sɛnea ebetumi aba sɛ w’awofo ho bɛtɔ wɔn wɔ wɔn ankasa fie asen beae foforo bi no ho
In the book You and Your Aging Parents Edith M
Edith M
Stern and Dr
Mabel Ross state Studies have shown that old folks stay younger and more truly alive in their own homes than elsewhere
Stern ne Oduruyɛfo Mabel Ross ka wɔ nhoma You and Your Aging Parents mu sɛ Nhwehwɛmu ada no adi sɛ wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim ahoɔden tra hɔ na wɔn adwene tumi yɛ adwuma yiye ankasa bere a wɔte wɔn ankasa afie sen sɛ wɔwɔ baabi foforo no
In short many misguided attempts to make declining years easy succeed only in making the decline more rapid
Ne tiatwa mu no nea efi mmɔden pii a ɛmfata a wɔbɔ sɛ wɔbɛma wɔn nkwakorabere anaa wɔn mmerewabere ayɛ mmerɛw ama wɔn mu ba ara ne sɛ ɛma wɔbɔ nkwakora anaa mmerewa ntɛmntɛm
So help your parents live as independently as possible while providing the care and services that they actually need
Enti boa w’awofo ma wɔn ankasa ntra sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara na bere koro no ara fa mmoa ne nneɛma a wohia ankasa ma wɔn
You should also make a periodic reassessment and readjust as your parents needs increase or even decrease
Ɛsɛ sɛ bere ne bere mu nso wosan susuw nneɛma ho na woyɛ nsakrae bere a w’awofo ahiade ahorow no dɔɔso anaasɛ ɛso tew mpo no
Be Sensitive	Ma W’ani Nna Hɔ
Given your parents health and circumstances it may be that bringing them into your home is the best option after all
Eyi nyinaa akyi no sɛ wususuw w’awofo akwahosan ne wɔn tebea ahorow ho a ebetumi aba sɛ nea eye sen biara a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ne sɛ wobɛma wɔabɛtra wo fie
If so be sensitive to the possibility that they prefer to do as much for themselves as possible
Sɛ ɛte saa a ma w’ani nna hɔ na hu sɛ ebetumi aba sɛ wɔpɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a wɔyɛ wɔn ankasa biribiara
Like people of any age they likely wish to have their own identity their own schedule of activities and their own set of friends
Te sɛ nnipa afoforo nyinaa no ebia wɔpɛ sɛ wɔda nsow wɔ afoforo ho wonya wɔn ankasa dwumadi ho nhyehyɛe ne wɔn ankasa nnamfo
This can be healthy
Eyi betumi ayɛ nea ɛfata
While it will be enjoyable to do some things together as an extended family it may be good for you to reserve some activities for just your immediate family and to allow your parents their own activities as well
Bere a ɛbɛyɛ anigye sɛ mo abusua no ne mo awofo bɛyɛ nneɛma bi abom no ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ dwumadi ahorow bi wɔ hɔ a wo ne w’ankasa w’abusua no nkutoo yɛ na woama w’awofo nso ayɛ wɔn ankasa dwumadi ahorow bi
One caregiver wisely pointed out Make sure your parents have familiar pieces of furniture and photographs that are special to them
Obi a ɔde ɔhwɛ ma fi nyansam daa no adi sɛ Hwɛ hu sɛ wode dan mu nneɛma ne mfonini dedaw a ɛsom bo ma w’awofo besiesie dan no mu
In endeavoring to discern your parents real needs talk to them
Bere a worebɔ mmɔden sɛ wubehu w’awofo ahiade ahorow no wone wɔn mmɔ nkɔmmɔ
Listen to their concerns and be sensitive to what they may be trying to tell you
Tie nea ehia wɔn na ma w’ani nna hɔ wɔ nea ebia wɔpɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ wo no ho
Explain to them what you can and cannot do for them so that they will not be hurt by false expectations
Kyerɛ wɔn nea wubetumi ayɛ ama wɔn ne nea wuntumi nyɛ na amma wɔannya anidaso hunu ma anhaw wɔn
Have a clear understanding as to what is to be expected from all in the family recommended one caregiver
Obi a ɔde ɔhwɛ ma hyɛɛ nyansa sɛ Te nea wɔhwehwɛ fi abusua no mufo nyinaa hɔ no ase yiye
Have frequent discussions to avoid hard feelings and built up resentments
Montaa mmɔ nkɔmmɔ na ama moakwati abufuw ne menasepɔw
If you make any long term promises I ll call you every Monday afternoon I ll take you out every weekend you may want to make it clear that you would like to try it for a certain period of time and see how it works

That way if it proves to be impractical the door is already open for reassessment
Saa kwan no so no sɛ antumi anyɛ yiye a hokwan wɔ hɔ dedaw a wubetumi de ayɛ nsakrae
None of the above should be taken as reasons to deprive one s parents of the honor and assistance due them
Ɛnsɛ sɛ obi gyina nea ɛwɔ atifi hɔ no mu biara so de nidi ne mmoa a ɛfata n’awofo no kame wɔn
The Creator s position on the subject is explicit
Nea Ɔbɔadeɛ no ka wɔ asɛm no ho no mu da hɔ
Adult children owe their parents respect care and support
Ɛsɛ sɛ mma a wɔanyinnyin de obu ɔhwɛ ne mmoa ma wɔn awofo
Jesus condemned the self righteous Pharisees for twisting scriptures to excuse the neglect of parents
Yesu buu Farisifo a wɔyɛ wɔn ho treneefo no fɔ sɛ wokyinkyim kyerɛw nsɛm de penee awofo a wobu ani gu wɔn so no so
The graphic words at Proverbs reveal the disgust that God feels toward those who disrespect their parents The eye that holds a father in derision and that despises obedience to a mother the ravens of the torrent valley will pick it out and the sons of the eagle will eat it up
See Mark Timothy
Nsɛm a emu da hɔ pefee a ɛwɔ Mmebusɛm yi kyerɛ sɛnea Onyankopɔn kyi wɔn a wɔnkyerɛ obu mma wɔn awofo no Aniwa a eyi n’agya ahii na ebu ɛna tie animtiaa no asubɔnten ho kwaakwaadabi betutu na akɔre mma bedi

Well your situation may be different
Ebetumi aba sɛ wo tebea no yɛ soronko
Your parents may have moved into your home after or more years of their living apart from you
Ebia wo ne w’awofo atetew mu mfe anaa nea ɛboro saa ansa na wɔretu abɛtra wo fie
This means that you and your parents formed life styles and habits independently of one another for the greater part of your lives
Eyi kyerɛ sɛ wo ne w’awofo anya asetra kwan ne su horow a ɛyɛ soronko wɔ obiara de ho wɔ mo asetra bere mu ɔfa kɛse mu
In the course of several decades those life styles and habits may have become very different
Wɔ mfe pii mu no saa asetra kwan ne su horow no betumi ayɛ soronko yiye
But now as a caregiver you are confronted with the need to blend your life harmoniously with those in your care
Nanso mprempren sɛ obi a wode ɔhwɛ ma no ɛho abehia sɛ woma w’asetra ne wɔn a worehwɛ wɔn no de hyia pɛpɛɛpɛ
This can be more difficult than if you had been living together all along

Too some parents may be quite ill or in other ways need more special care
Nea ɛka ho no ebia na awofo binom yare kɛse anaa wɔ akwan afoforo so no wohia ɔhwɛ soronko bi
Although commendably you may be supplying what is required and see no present need to put your parents in a nursing home this situation understandably puts day to day pressures on all of you
Ɛwom sɛ ebia wobɔ mmɔden pii de nea w’awofo hia ma wɔn nti mprempren wunhu hia a ɛho hia sɛ wode wɔn bɛkɔ beae a wɔhwɛ wɔn a wɔn mfe kɔ anim de nanso sɛnea ntease wom no saa tebea yi de da biara da mu ɔhaw ahorow brɛ wo
Caring for your parents is natural
W’awofo a wobɛhwɛ wɔn no yɛ asetra fa
Growing old and getting sick is not
Onyin ne ɔyare nyɛ asetra fa
The Creator never purposed that people lose their strength and health with age
Ɔbɔadeɛ no ammɔ ne tirim da sɛ nnipa nhwere wɔn ahoɔden ne wɔn akwahosan bere a wɔrenyin no
Therefore do not think there is something wrong with you because the situation requires more emotionally and physically than you had foreseen
Genesis Psalm

Pressures related to caregiving do not necessarily reflect a poor relationship between you and your parents
Ɔhaw ahorow a efi ɔhwɛ a wɔde ma mu ba no nkyerɛ ankasa sɛ wo ne w’awofo nni abusuabɔ pa
Especially if you enjoyed a good relationship with them before they needed your help it is likely that any difficulties you experience are the result of the challenges that caregiving can present
Ne titiriw no sɛ na wo ne wɔn wɔ abusuabɔ pa ansa na worefi ase ahwɛ wɔn a ɛda adi sɛ nsɛnnennen biara a wuhyia no fi ɔhaw ahorow a ɔhwɛ a wɔde ma betumi de aba no

Dealing With Guilt Feelings	Afobu Nkate a Wodi ho Dwuma
Even persons who are doing all they can and should for their parents sometimes feel guilty about not doing more
Ɛtɔ da bi a wɔn a wɔreyɛ nea wobetumi ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nyinaa de boa wɔn awofo mpo bu wɔn ho fɔ sɛ nea wɔyɛ no sua
Inappropriate guilt however can be a problem
Nanso bu a obi bebu ne ho fɔ ɔkwan a ɛmfata so no betumi ayɛ asɛnnennen
You can find yourself making decisions that are designed to relieve your guilt but are not necessarily in the best interests of you or your parents
Ebetumi aba sɛ wubesisi gyinae bi a n’atirimpɔw ne sɛ ɛbɛma woade wo ho afi afobu nka a wote no ho nanso ɛso remma wo anaa w’awofo mfaso kɛse ankasa
For example what would happen if to alleviate her feelings of inappropriate guilt a woman became absorbed in caregiving to the neglect of her own husband and children ?	Sɛ nhwɛso no dɛn na ɛbɛba bere a ɔbea bi a esiane sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔma afobu nkate a ɛmfata a ɔwɔ no brɛ ase nti ɔma ɔhwɛ a ɔde ma no gye n’adwene araa ma obu n’ani gu ne kunu ne ne mma so ?
She her husband and her children would suffer the consequences
Ɔno ne kunu ne ne mma behu amane
So do not let inappropriate guilt control your life
Enti mma afobu nkate a ɛmfata nni w’asetra so
Do you sometimes feel guilty because it seems that you can never do enough for your parents ?	So ɛtɔ da bi a wote afobu nka esiane sɛ ɛte sɛ nea wuntumi mfa mmoa a ɛfata mma w’awofo nti ?
It is possible then that your parents needs exceed what you are able to provide
Ɛte saa a ebetumi aba sɛ w’awofo ahiade ahorow boro nea wubetumi de ama no so
The situation may be such that no matter what you do there is always more that could be done
Ebetumi aba sɛ ɛmfa ho nea wobɛyɛ biara no wubehu sɛ pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ bere nyinaa
Furthermore if you view caregiving as a means of repaying your parents for all that they did in your behalf while you were growing up in their care you will always feel guilty because you simply cannot fully repay them
Afei nso sɛ wubu ɔhwɛ a wode ma no sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan a worefa so atua w’awofo ka wɔ nea wɔyɛ maa wo bere a wɔhwɛɛ wo wɔ wo mmofraberem no mu a wobɛte afobu nka bere nyinaa efisɛ worentumi ntua wɔn ka nwie
The book You and Your Aging Parents points out the need to decide how much you will do for your parents
Nhoma You and Your Aging Parents da no adi sɛ ɛho hia sɛ wusi gyinae wɔ nneɛma dodow a wobɛyɛ de aboa w’awofo ho
It says You will save yourself a great deal of wear and tear if you base your decisions primarily not on what you would like to do or even what you should do but what you can do
Ese Sɛ woamfa wo gyinaesi ahorow no annyina nea wobɛpɛ sɛ woyɛ anaa nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mpo so titiriw na mmom wode gyina nea wubetumi ayɛ so a wobɛkwati nkate fam ɔhaw bebree
Yes determine realistically what you can expect of yourself
Yiw hu nea ntease wom sɛ wubetumi ayɛ ankasa
It might help if you enlist the aid of a trusted friend who knows your abilities your limitations and your family situation
Ebetumi ayɛ wo mmoa sɛ wubehu w’adamfo bi a wowɔ ne mu ahotoso a onim wo mmɔdenbɔ wo mmerɛwyɛ ne w’abusua mu nsɛm tebea adwene wɔ nea wususuw no ho
Can you take your parents into your home ?	So wubetumi ama w’awofo abɛtra wo fie ?
Do you have sufficient space ?	Wowɔ ɔkwan a ɛfata wɔ hɔ ?
Will they agree to move in ?	Wɔbɛpene so sɛ wobetu ?
If your parents do not live with you how often can you visit them and when ?	Sɛ w’awofo nte wo nkyɛn a mpɛn ahe na wubetumi akɔsra wɔn na bere bɛn ?
If you do what you can there is no need to feel guilty
Sɛ woyɛ nea wubetumi a ɛho nhia sɛ wobɛte afobu biara nka
If you feel guilty anyway recognize the feeling as inappropriate and refuse to let it govern your decisions
Sɛ ɛba sɛ wote afobu nka a hu sɛ ɛmfata na mma kwan mma enni wo gyinaesi ahorow so
Share the Load	Wone Afoforo Nkyɛ Asɛyɛde No
The Bible book of Ecclesiastes points out how unhealthy it is to be wicked overmuch or righteous overmuch and that being righteous overmuch can cause desolation to yourself
Ɔsɛnkafo nhoma a ɛwɔ Bible mu no da no adi sɛ ɛmfata sɛ woyɛ abɔnefosɛm dodo ’ anaa ɔtreneeni bebrebe na wo ho a wobɛyɛ no ɔtreneeni bebrebe no betumi ama woasɛe wo ho

This can happen if you are trying to accomplish more than you want to do can do and even should do
Eyi betumi aba bere a wobɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ pii asen nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ nea wubetumi ayɛ ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mpo no
If you already had a full schedule before starting to care for your parents you must eliminate some other activities or get help
Sɛ na wowɔ nhyehyɛe a dwumadi pii wom dedaw ansa na worefi ase ahwɛ w’awofo a ɛsɛ sɛ wuyiyi dwumadi bi fi mu anaa wohwehwɛ mmoa
Yet many who need help hesitate to ask

They may feel too timid or claim that others are unwilling to assist
Ebetumi aba sɛ wɔfɛre dodo anaa wɔkyerɛ sɛ afoforo mpɛ sɛ wɔboa
However you do yourself and everyone around you a disservice if you wear yourself down

Yes you may need to share the load
Yiw ebia ɛho behia sɛ wone afoforo kyɛ asɛyɛde no
So where can you go for help ?	Ɛnde ɛhe na wubetumi akɔhwehwɛ mmoa ?
Family friends neighbors and professionals can be of assistance
Abusuafo nnamfo afipamfo ne wɔn a wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim hwɛ mu betumi ayɛ wo mmoa
But you have to ask for the help
Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wubisa mmoa
And you must ask directly
Na ɛsɛ sɛ wubisa no tee
Hints don t always work
Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nsɛm a wɔnka no pefee tumi sow aba
You may be surprised who and how many are willing to assist if you make your needs clearly known your requests definite

For example you might ask someone to help you clean the house
Sɛ nhwɛso no wubetumi asrɛ obi sɛ ɔmmoa wo na siesie fie hɔ
If that would give you some needed relief then this is no time to insist on cleaning the house yourself because nobody else will do it right

If you have brothers or sisters they also share the responsibility of caring for their parents
Sɛ wowɔ nuanom mmarima ne mmea a wɔn nso wɔ asɛyɛde sɛ wɔhwɛ wɔn awofo
Perhaps you have done all or most of the caregiving up to now believing that your brothers and sisters are unable or unwilling
Ebia wo na wode ɔhwɛ no nyinaa anaa fa kɛse no ama de abesi nnɛ na wugye di sɛ wo nuanom mmarima ne mmea no ntumi mmoa anaasɛ wɔmpɛ sɛ wɔboa
However have you directly requested their assistance ?	Nanso so woabisa wɔn tee sɛ wɔmmoa ?
Some people will respond positively if it is made clear to them that help is needed
Ebinom bɛboa sɛ woma emu da hɔ ma wohu sɛ wɔn mmoa ho hia a
Some monopolize the care of a parent in an attempt to gain or to maintain parental approval
Ebinom nkutoo gye awofo hwɛ no to wɔn ho so de bɔ mmɔden nya awofo anim dom
Or they may gain a feeling of piety by taking on the whole job themselves
Anaa ebia wɔbɛte nka sɛ wɔnam adwuma no nyinaa a wɔde bɛto wɔn ho so no so bɛda wɔn ho adi sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa pa
They may complain that others will not assist with the caregiving but they may also send out signals to show that they prefer it that way
Ebetumi aba sɛ wobenwiinwii aka sɛ afoforo mmoa wɔn wɔ ɔhwɛ a wɔde ma no mu nanso ebia wɔnam wɔn nsɛm a wɔka ne nneyɛe so akyerɛ sɛ saa na wɔpɛ no
This can be a form of being righteous overmuch
Eyi betumi ayɛ treneefo bebrebe a wɔyɛ
But why bring unnecessary hardships on yourself ?	Nanso dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ wode ɔhaw a ɛho nhia to wo ho so ?
If help is available ask for it and use it
Sɛ mmoa wɔ hɔ a bisa na nya mu mfaso
A word of caution Do not expect that your brothers and sisters will share the responsibilities equally with you
Kɔkɔbɔ bi ni Ɛnsɛ sɛ wohwɛ kwan sɛ wo nuanom ne wo bɛkyɛ asɛyɛde no pɛpɛɛpɛ
While at times it may be possible for them to do so often their own circumstances make that difficult if not impossible

In many cases it is more practical for one family member to be the primary caregiver while other family members particularly brothers and sisters contribute financially and by phoning visiting or occasionally taking their parents home or on weekend trips
Wɔ nsɛm pii mu no mfaso wɔ so kɛse sɛ obusuani biako titiriw na ɔde ɔhwɛ no ma bere a abusuafo afoforo titiriw ne nuanom mmarima ne mmea de honam fam nneɛma boa na wɔfrɛ wɔn wɔ telefon so wɔkɔsra wɔn anaa ɛtɔ da bi a wɔde wɔn pue wɔ dapɛn no awiei no
Close Living	Faako a Wɔtra
Living in close quarters can give rise to small irritations
Faako a wɔtra tumi ma akasakasa nketenkete sɔre
Habits that you would easily excuse in a friend may seem intolerable in a close family member
Su horow bi a sɛ w’adamfo bi da no adi a ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wubenya ho abotare no betumi ayɛ nea sɛ wo busuani a ɔbɛn wo da no adi a worennya ho koma
Additionally your parent may say something like I wish you could spend more time with me but I know you re too busy for that
Nea ɛka ho no ebia w’awofo bɛka biribi te sɛ eyi Me yam a anka wunya bere pii ma me nanso minim sɛ wunni adagyew pii a wode bɛyɛ saa
’
The message may hide the belief that you really don t care enough about your parent
Ebia adwene a ɛwɔ akyiri ankasa ne sɛ wunnwen wo wofo no ho ahe biara
You could respond to such a statement with annoyance
Ebetumi aba sɛ wode abufuw bebua asɛm a ɛte sɛɛ
Rather than becoming annoyed would it not be better to address your parent s real underlying concern that of spending more time with you ?	Sɛ anka wo bo befuw no so ɛrenyɛ papa sɛ wubedi wo wofo no ahiade ankasa a ɛne sɛ ɔne wo bɛbɔ nkɔmmɔ pii no ho dwuma ?
Even if you cannot grant the request kindly explaining matters will yield better results than a hurtful reply
Proverbs

Earnest effort at cultivating the qualities encouraged in the Bible will enable you to remain kind but firm when necessary
Mmɔden kɛse a wobɛbɔ sɛ wubenya su horow a wɔhyɛ ho nkuran wɔ Bible mu no bɛma woada ayamye adi na woasi gyinae pintinn bere a ɛho abehia saa no
The Bible book of Colossians realistically acknowledges that we sometimes have cause for complaint against another
Kolosefo nhoma a ɛwɔ Bible mu no ka ma ɛfata sɛ ɛtɔ da bi a yɛne obi nya asɛm bi
It directs us to continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely
Ɛhyɛ yɛn sɛ yɛnkɔ so nhuhu mma yɛn ho na yɛmfa nkyekyɛ yɛn ho
’
It also exhorts us to clothe ourselves with the tender affections of compassion kindness lowliness of mind mildness and long suffering
Etu yɛn fo nso sɛ yɛnhyɛ ayamhyehye ayamye ahobrɛase adwene odwo ne abodwokyɛre
Certainly such qualities will go a long way to minimize the irritations of close living
Ɛda adi sɛ su a ɛtete saa bɛboa yiye ma akasakasa a wɔn a wɔte faako nya no so atew
Even then if you occasionally slip lose patience and say something you wish you hadn t let the sun not set with you in a provoked state
Sɛ ɛba sɛ wudi mfomso wo bo fuw na woka biribi a anka wompɛ sɛ woka saa bere no mpo a mma owia nkɔtɔ w’abufuw so
’
Apologize quickly and put the matter behind you
Pa kyɛw ntɛm na ma wo werɛ mfi asɛm no
Do not allow it to become another source of guilt feelings

Retaining Privacy	Bere a Obiara Benya Ayɛ N’ade
If you and your parents live in the same home you may find privacy difficult
Sɛ wo ne w’awofo te fie biako mu a ebia wubehu sɛ ɛyɛ den sɛ wubenya bere ayɛ w’ade
Yet you and your parents need a measure of it
Nanso wo ne w’awofo hia bere a mode bɛyɛ mo ankasa mo ade
You might talk this problem over with them and arrive at an understanding that certain times and places are private for you or your immediate family
Wubetumi ne wɔn asusuw asɛnnennen yi ho na woama wɔate ase sɛ bere ne mmeae horow bi yɛ nea w’abusua de bɛyɛ wɔn kokoam nneɛma
For instance for some families but not all a closed door with a do not disturb sign might be mutually understood as indicating a private area or time for the person inside
Sɛ nhwɛso no wɔ mmusua bi mu no obiara betumi ate ase sɛ ɔpon a wɔato mu na wɔde ahyɛde bi abɔ pon no ano sɛ obiara mma hɔ no kyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bere a nea ɔwɔ hɔ no reyɛ n’ankasa ade bi
If the room does not have a door a portable screen or a partition could serve the same purpose
Sɛ ɔpon nna dan no ano a biribi a wɔde begye hɔ anaa ntama bi a wɔde betwa mu no betumi adi atirimpɔw koro no ara ho dwuma
A tactful reminder might be in order if needed privacy is unexpectedly interrupted
Sɛ obi bɛhaw wo bere a woreyɛ w’ankasa ade bi a ebia ɛbɛfata sɛ wode anifere kae no nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ
The point is one another s need for privacy should be respected by all in the family
Asɛm no ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ abusua muni biara kyerɛ obu ma ɔfoforo na ɔnhaw no bere a n’ankasa yɛ n’ade
A Privilege	Hokwan Bi
Remember that although any decline in your parents health causes you pain our Creator Jehovah wants us to experience a measure of joy even when we undergo trialsome circumstances
Kae sɛ ɛwom sɛ w’awofo akwahosan a ɛso tew no ma wodi yaw de nanso yɛn Bɔfo Yehowa pɛ sɛ yenya anigye kodu baabi bere a yehyia sɔhwɛ ahorow mpo no
This work may also help you draw closer to Jehovah as you prayerfully lean on him
Saa adwuma yi bɛboa wo nso ma woabɛn Yehowa bere a wonam mpaebɔ so de wo ho to no so no
One caregiver expressed it this way I was always close to Jehovah but caregiving taught me total reliance on him
Obi a ɔde ɔhwɛ ma kaa ho asɛm sɛɛ Na mebɛn Yehowa bere nyinaa nanso ɔhwɛ a mede mae no kyerɛɛ me sɛnea mede me ho bɛto no so korakora
It was like the difference between a long distance phone call and having the person there with you
Na ɛte sɛ nsonsonoe a ɛwɔ obi a ɔwɔ akyirikyiri a wone no kasa wɔ telefon so ne bere a onii no wɔ wo nkyɛn mu no
Jehovah was right there with me
Na Yehowa wɔ me nkyɛn pɛɛ
Caregiving is a privilege as well as a duty
Ɔhwɛ a wɔde ma yɛ hokwan na ɛyɛ asɛyɛde nso
Stay in touch with your parents so as to know their needs
Wone w’awofo mmɔ nkɔmmɔ na ama woahu wɔn ahiade ahorow
Provide for them and maintain joy in doing so

Making Caregiving Pleasant	Ɔhwɛ a Wɔbɛma Ayɛ Anigye
What parents generally want from their adult children is quality contact
Nea awofo taa hwehwɛ fi wɔn mma a wɔanyinnyin hɔ ne sɛ wɔne wɔn bedi nkitaho kɛse
This requires drawing close to your parents and revealing important aspects of yourself
Eyi hwehwɛ sɛ wobɛbɛn w’awofo na woada wo su horow a ɛho hia adi
This can be difficult in a parent adult child relationship
Eyi betumi ayɛ den wɔ awofo ne wɔn mma a wɔanyinnyin abusuabɔ mu
Any judgmental attitudes on either side will stand in the way
Katee a mo mu biara bɛyɛ no bɛyɛ akwanside ama eyi
Such attitudes need to be set aside to achieve intimacy
Ɛsɛ sɛ muyi su horow a ɛtete saa fi hɔ na ama moatumi abɔ
If one of your parents is telling you of a problem or a concern listen empathetically
Sɛ w’awofo no mu biako reka asɛnnennen bi anaa biribi a ɛhaw no ho asɛm akyerɛ wo a fi tema mu tie
Answers that minimize their feelings can intensify negative feelings such as Oh it s not as bad as all that or I know the same things happen to me
Mmuae horow a ɛka wɔn kasaboa hyɛ wɔn yam betumi ama wɔanya nkate a ɛmfata te sɛ eyi Oh sɛɛ asɛm yi koraa nhaw adwene pii sɛnea na misusuw no ’ anaa Minim mihyia tebea koro no ara
’
You will be more effective if you try to identify your parent s underlying feelings then acknowledge and share these Sounds like a hard time for you right now but we ll work through it together
Proverbs
Ɛbɛyɛ papa mmom sɛ wobɔ mmɔden hwehwɛ nkate horow a ɛkanyan w’awofo wugye tom na woka ho asɛm Ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ den ma wo mprempren nanso yɛbɛbom adi ho dwuma ’
Mmebusɛm
If you are the spouse of the primary caregiver be physically and emotionally supportive
Sɛ wo hokafo na awofo hwɛ ho adesoa yi da no so titiriw a boa no wɔ honam ne nkate fam
Communicate with your mate otherwise misunderstandings will develop
Wone wo hokafo mmɔ nkɔmmɔ anyɛ saa a akasakasa bɛsɔre
A mate s support makes a big difference
Mmoa a ɔhokafo de ma no boa kɛse
One woman lamented that the lack of support from her family was harder to deal with than actually caring for her mother
Ɔbea biako kae sɛ na boa a n’abusua mmoa no no yɛ den sen ne maame hwɛ no ankasa
On the other hand she deeply appreciated the help of a friend who relieved her on occasion
Nanso n’ani sɔɔ mmoa a na n’adamfo bi de ma bere ne bere mu no kɛse
She said It touched my heart when she offered
Ɔkae sɛ Ɛkaa me koma bere a otuu ne ho mae no
That was so endearing to me and it drew me closer to her

You likely know that this only results in less control and more stress
Ebia wunim sɛ nea eyi de bɛba ara ne sɛ ommua wo na ɛde ɔhaw pii bɛba
Results are better when you show your adult children that you respect them their privacy and their viewpoints even when you do not agree

One adult offspring stated A child wants his parents approval no matter what age he is
Oba bi a wanyin kae sɛ Ɔba pɛ n’awofo anim dom ɛmfa ho mfe a wadi no
In such a climate of love and respect communicate your needs to your children

Hints and implications often do more harm than good so be direct but kind

What Kind of Divorcing Does God Hate ?	Awaregyae Bɛn na Onyankopɔn Kyi ?
 THE problems that went along with my divorce were many wrote one Christian woman whose husband had been unfaithful
KRISTONI bea bi a ne kunu anni nokware kyerɛwee sɛ Nsɛnnnennen a m’awaregyae de bae no dɔɔso
The adjustment period isn t an easy time
Bere a wɔde yɛ nsakrae no mu yɛ den
I had to adjust not only mentally but financially and spiritually as well
Ɛnyɛ m’adwenem nko na na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nsakrae na mmom sikasɛm ne honhom mu nso
I wondered if Jehovah would bless my decision knowing that the Scriptures say that he hates divorce
Na misuro sɛ ebia Yehowa rempene me gyinaesi no so efisɛ na minim sɛ Kyerɛwnsɛm no ka sɛ okyi awaregyae
This was a constant worry
Na ɛno haw me bere nyinaa
When a marriage ends the complications do not
Sɛ aware ba awiei a emu ɔhaw no mma awiei
A whole new set of problems suddenly arise
Ɔhaw afoforo koraa sɔre mpofirim
The feelings depression loneliness and guilt that surface out of nowhere
Nkate horow adwenemhaw ankonamyɛ ne afobu nka a wɔte a ɛba mpofirim

Trying to cope with the desire for the intimacies that only marriage allows

Then there is God s view to think about
Afei Onyankopɔn nsusuwii nso wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wodwen ho
The Bible says that God hates a divorcing
Bible ka sɛ Onyankopɔn kyi awaregyae
’
Do these words mean that God hates all divorcing ?	So saa nsɛm yi kyerɛ sɛ Onyankopɔn kyi awaregyae biara ?
Does a Christian therefore need to feel guilty for seeking a divorce when a mate has been unfaithful ?	Enti so ɛho hia sɛ Kristoni te afobu nka sɛ wagyae ne hokafo bi a wanni nokware ?
For the answers let us look at the circumstances in Malachi s day that prompted God to say that he hates divorce
Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ na yɛanya mmuae no momma yɛnhwɛ tebea horow a na ɛwɔ Malaki nna no mu a ɛkaa Onyankopɔn ma ɔkae sɛ okyi awaregyae no
You Must Not Deal Treacherously 	 Munntwa Nkontompo 
Malachi prophesied after B
C
E
almost a century after the Jewish exiles returned from Babylon
Malaki hyɛɛ nkɔm wɔ afe A
Y
B
akyi bɛyɛ mfe ɔha fi bere a Yudafo no fi nnommum mu wɔ Babilon bae no
Deplorable conditions had developed in Judah especially among the priests
Na tebea bɔne afi ase wɔ Yuda titiriw wɔ asɔfo no mu
Practices such as lying adultery fraud and oppression were prevalent among the Israelites in general
Na nneyɛe ahorow te sɛ atorodi awaresɛe nsisi ne nhyɛso abu so wɔ Israelfo no mu
These conditions provoked so much skepticism that some concluded It is of no value to serve God
Malachi
Tebea horow yi maa ebinom adwenem yɛɛ wɔn naa araa ma wɔkae sɛ Onyankopɔn som yɛ ɔkwa
Malaki
The religious and moral decay in Malachi s day was reflected also in a declining respect for marriage
Ɔsom ne abrabɔ mu ɔporɔw a na ɛkɔ so wɔ Malaki nna no mu no daa adi nso wɔ obu a na wonni mma aware mu
Many Israelite men were divorcing the wives of their youth perhaps in order to marry younger pagan women
Na Israelfo mmarima pii regyaagyae wɔn mmerantebere mu yerenom ebia wɔyɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobenya hokwan awareware mmabaa a wɔyɛ abosonsomfo
The altar of Jehovah became covered with the tears of the rejected wives who came to the sanctuary to weep and sigh before God
Malachi
Ɔyerenom a na wɔn kununom agyae wɔn aware a na wɔba kronkronbea hɔ besu na wosi apini Onyankopɔn anim no de nusu kataa Yehowa afɔremuka no so
Malaki
How did Jehovah God feel about such divorcing ?	Yehowa tee nka dɛn wɔ awaregyae a ɛtete saa no ho ?
Through Malachi he warned You people must guard yourselves respecting your spirit and with the wife of your youth may no one deal treacherously
Ɔnam Malaki so bɔɔ kɔkɔ sɛ Monhwɛ mo ho yiye mo honhom ho na ntwa wo mmerantebere mu yere nkontompo
For he has hated a divorcing Jehovah the God of Israel has said
And you must guard yourselves respecting your spirit and you must not deal treacherously
Na metan awaregu Yehowa Israel Nyankopɔn na ose
enti monhwɛ mo ho yiye mo honhom ho na munntwa nkontompo
According to the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament the Hebrew word rendered deal treacherously means deal deceitfully deal unfaithfully
Sɛnea Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament kyerɛ no Hebri asɛmfua a wɔakyerɛ ase ntwa nkontompo ’ no kyerɛ nnnaadaa nni atoro
At Psalm a participle form of this verb is rendered traitors
Wɔ Dwom no wɔkyerɛ adeyɛ asɛm yi a ɛwɔ edin nkyerɛkyerɛmu kabea mu ase sɛ nkontompofo
Against such a background we can better understand the words at Malachi He has hated a divorcing
Bere a yenim eyi no yebetumi ate nsɛm a ɛwɔ Malaki no ase yiye Okyi awaregyae
’
Jehovah hates the kind of divorcing that involves the frivolous putting away of one mate in order to take another
Awaregyae a Yehowa kyi ne nea wogyina asɛnhunu biara so yɛ saa na ama wɔanya hokwan aware foforo no
For example a man who commits adultery and then divorces his innocent mate against her wishes or pressures her to divorce him so that he can marry someone else would indeed be dealing treacherously with his wife
Sɛ nhwɛso no ɔbarima bi a ɔsɛe aware na afei ogyae ne yere a ne ho nni asɛm no bere a ɔbea no mpene so anaa ɔhyɛ ɔbea no sɛ onnyaa no aware sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obetumi aware onipa foforo no bɛyɛ obi a na ɔretwa ne yere nkontompo ampa
This deceitful faithless treatment of an innocent mate is a heinous sin in God s eyes
Ɔhokafo a ne ho nni asɛm a wɔdaadaa no na wonni no nokware saa no yɛ bɔne a anibere wom wɔ Onyankopɔn anim
A man who takes the best years of a woman s life and then puts her away perhaps in favor of a younger woman is indeed a traitor
Ɔbarima a ɔne ɔbea tra wɔ ne mmabaaberem na afei ogyae no aware bere a wanyin na ebia ɔkɔhwehwɛ ababaa bi yɛ nkontomponi ampa
What though about an innocent mate who chooses to divorce a spouse who has committed adultery ?	Ɛnde ɔhokafo a ne ho nni asɛm a ɔpaw sɛ obegyae ɔhokafo a wasɛe aware no nso ɛ ?
Does God hate such divorces too ?	So Onyankopɔn kyi awaregyae a ɛte saa nso ?
God s Own Example	Onyankopɔn Ankasa Nhwɛso
Can God really know what it feels like to be faced with the decision of whether to divorce an adulterous mate or not ?	So Onyankopɔn betumi ahu sɛnea gyinae a ɛsɛ sɛ obi si sɛ obegyae ɔhokafo bi a wasɛe aware anaasɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ogyae no no te ankasa no ?
Symbolically speaking Jehovah considered himself married to the ancient nation of Israel by means of his covenant with them
Sɛnkyerɛnne kwan so no Yehowa faa no sɛ na ɔware tete Israel man no denam apam a ɔne wɔn yɛe no so
As a husband Jehovah was ever faithful never turning his affections to other nations
Sɛ okunu no Yehowa dii nokware bere nyinaa wamfa ne dɔ amma aman afoforo bi da
But what about Israel ?	Na Israel nso ɛ ?
What kind of wife did the nation prove to be ?	Ɔyere bɛn na ɔman no yɛe ?
As a whole the nation repeatedly proved unfaithful to the covenant eventually reaching the state described in the prayer recorded at Daniel We have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled and there has been a turning aside from your commandments and from your judicial decisions
Mpɛn pii na ɔman mu no anni nokware wɔ apam no ho maa awiei koraa no ekoduu baabi a wɔaka ho asɛm wɔ mpae a wɔayɛ ho kyerɛwtohɔ wɔ Daniel no Yɛayɛ bɔne afom so adi abɔnefosɛm atew atua yɛafi wo mmara nsɛm ne w’atemmude ho akɔ
And we have not listened to your servants the prophets who have spoken in your name to our kings our princes and our forefathers and to all the people of the land
Na yɛantie wo nkoa adiyifo a wɔde wo din kasa kyerɛɛ yɛn ahene yɛn mmapɔmma ne yɛn agyanom ne asase no so man nyinaa no
In Jehovah s eyes such unfaithfulness was tantamount to a wife s committing adultery
Jeremiah
Na nokware a wɔanni saa no te sɛ ɔyere a wasɛe aware wɔ Yehowa ani so
Yeremia
After centuries of patience and long suffering what did Jehovah do ?	Abotare ne abodwokyere a Yehowa yii no adi mfeha pii akyi no dɛn na ɔyɛe ?
By taking strong judicial action casting first the northern tribes then the southern tribes out of their land into exile Jehovah in effect divorced himself from the nation
Yehowa nam atemmu a emu yɛ den a ɔde baa wɔn so tuu kusuu fam ne afei kesee fam mmusua no fii wɔn nsase so kɔɔ nnommum mu so gyaee ɔman no aware sɛ yɛbɛka no saa a
So in view of his own example how could Jehovah God hate it when an innocent mate chooses to divorce a spouse who has been unfaithful to the marriage vow ?	Enti esiane nea Yehowa Nyankopɔn ankasa yɛe nti sɛ obi a ne ho nni asɛm paw sɛ obegyae ne hokafo a wanni aware ntam no ho nokware a ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na obekyi ?
Marriage is a sacred arrangement in God s eyes and those who enter it should not take lightly the vow they have made
Aware yɛ nhyehyɛe kronkron wɔ Onyankopɔn ani so na ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyem no bu aware ntam a wɔka no adewa
But if one s mate is unfaithful to the vow by committing fornication God grants the innocent one the right to decide whether to forgive or to seek a divorce
Nanso sɛ obi hokafo anni nokware wɔ aware ntam no ho na ɔkɔbɔ aguaman a Onyankopɔn ma ɔhokafo a ne ho nni asɛm no kwan ma osi gyinae sɛ ɔde bɛkyɛ no anaasɛ obegyae no aware
That is a difficult decision one that the innocent mate alone must make
Eyi yɛ gyinaesi a ɛyɛ den a ɔhokafo a ne ho nni asɛm no nkutoo na ɛsɛ sɛ osi
Should the innocent one decide to end the marriage he or she need not feel guilty for seeking a divorce
Sɛ ɛba sɛ ɔhokafo a ne ho nni asɛm no si gyinae sɛ obegyae aware a enhia sɛ ɔte afobu nka sɛ wagyae aware
Remember that Jehovah hates not all divorcing but the kind of divorcing that involves the unscriptural putting away of one mate in order to take another
Kae sɛ ɛnyɛ awaregyae biara na Yehowa kyi na mmom awaregyae a enni kyerɛw nsɛm mu nnyinaso a obi gyae ne hokafo sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obenya hokwan aware foforo no
Footnotes 	 Ase hɔ nsɛm 
Throughout the Scriptures Jehovah God speaks of himself as hating attitudes and forms of conduct that are sinful
Yehowa Nyankopɔn ka no wɔ Kyerɛwnsɛm no mu nyinaa sɛ okyi suban ne nneyɛe ahorow a ɛyɛ bɔne
Viewed in this light the divorcing referred to at Malachi must also be of a type that is sinful in his eyes
Sɛ yesusuw asɛm yi ho wɔ saa kwan yi so a ɛnde na awaregyae a wɔaka ho asɛm wɔ Malaki no nso bɛyɛ awaregyae a ɛyɛ bɔne wɔ n’anim
Divorce from an adulterous mate is a personal decision
Ɔhokafo a wasɛe aware a wogyae no no yɛ ankorankoro gyinaesi
For a discussion of the various factors that the innocent mate can weigh in deciding whether to obtain a Scriptural divorce please see the Watchtower issues of August page and May pages to

To grasp the change just go to a carpet shop in Istanbul hire a guide in Eastern Europe or visit a department store in Sydney

Kosher Foods Better ?	Japan AIDS
Over kosher products can be found on U
S
supermarket shelves and are being bought by many who are not religious Jews or devout Muslims who have a similar dietary code
Sɛnea aban amanneɛbɔ kyerɛ no wɔ nnipa ɔpepem a wɔte Japan man mu no wɔn a wɔayɛ wɔn mu nhwehwɛmu ahu sɛ wɔanya AIDS mmoawa no nnu
Why ? Because people associate the term with purity and wholesomeness says Tufts University Diet Nutrition Letter
Nsɛmma nhoma The Economist ka sɛ Nanso wɔ kokoam no ayaresabea adwumayɛfo a ebinom yɛ adwuma wɔ apɔwmuden asoɛe no gye di sɛ wɔn a wɔwɔ AIDS mmoawa no bi dɔɔso sen dodow a wɔde ato gua no
But the kosher dietary laws or kashruth were set forth to protect not the health of the body but rather of the soul so to speak and that doesn t mean meat that passes kosher inspections is necessarily better for you than non kosher meat
Nsɛmma nhoma no kae sɛ wogye di sɛ nea ɛboro Japanfo a wɔwɔ yare bi a wɔfrɛ no haemophiliac mogya a etu obi no mu fa na wɔwɔ HIV mmoawa a wɔde AIDS ba no bi na ade biako nti a ɛte saa ne aduru bi a wɔde mogya yɛ a wɔfrɛ no Factor a na AIDS mmoawa no bi wom a wɔde maa wɔn no
The Jewish food inspector looks for meat that meets the dietary standards derived from the Torah such as the draining of blood but he is not trained to look as thoroughly for signs of infection or disease as government inspectors are

Yet we must assume that some of the other runners in the contest also prayed to God for victory and lost

Then one knocks the other out

At other bouts only one fighter may petition God for victory yet he is as often the loser as not

In team sports groups of players may pray before during or even after a game

For example during the last seconds of an American Super Bowl football game a kicker lined up for the crucial field goal that would win the game for his team or lose it if he missed

The kicker later said I was praying about it
Bɔɔlbɔni no kae akyiri yi sɛ Na merebɔ ho mpae
But some of the opposing team were also praying about it for the opposite outcome
Nanso na kuw a wɔne wɔn resi akan no nso mufo bi rebɔ mpae na wanhyɛ
Although both sides may pray one side must lose
Ɛwom sɛ ebia akuw abien no nyinaa bɛbɔ mpae de nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obiako di nkogu
Even a winning team whose players prayed for victory can lose the next game
Kuw a emu agodifo bɔ mpae na wodi nkonim no betumi adi nkogu wɔ agodi a edi hɔ no mu
Indeed eventually by the end of the season all other teams must lose for there can be only one overall champion in a league

Another sportswriter observed God does not take sides in football games
Agodi ho sɛnkyerɛwfo foforo kae sɛ Onyankopɔn nnyina ɔfa bi akyi wɔ bɔɔlbɔ mu
Temporal matters like these are decided by men and women not the Almighty

Ɔsomafo Petro kyerɛw sɛ Onyankopɔn nhwɛ onipa anim na mmom ɔman biara mu nea osuro no na ɔyɛ ade trenee no ɔpɛ no agye no
Engaging in violent sports is not working righteousness
Agodi a basabasayɛ wom a obi de ne ho hyem no nyɛ ade treneeyɛ

If God did hear the prayers of those asking for victory and a contestant was injured or even killed would God be to blame ?	Sɛ Onyankopɔn tie wɔn a wɔhwehwɛ nkonimdi no mpae no na agodifo no mu bi pira anaa wokum no a so wɔde ɛho asodi bɛto Onyankopɔn so ?
God s Word states No matter what it is that we ask according to his will he hears us
Onyankopɔn Asɛm ka sɛ Yɛsrɛ biribiara sɛnea ɔpɛ a otie yɛn
For prayers to be answered one must know God s will and purposes and one s actions must be in harmony with such
Compare Matthew
Ansa na wobebua obi mpae no ɛsɛ sɛ onii no hu Onyankopɔn apɛde ne n’atirimpɔw ahorow na ne nneyɛe ne no hyia

No God s will and purposes are not connected with sports events
Dabi Onyankopɔn apɛde ne atirimpɔw ahorow mfa agodi ho
Thus when prayers for victory are offered at them is God listening ?	Enti sɛ wɔbɔ nkonimdi ho mpae wɔ agodi mu a so Onyankopɔn tie ?
Most assuredly not

Lack of Opportunity	Hokwan a Wonnya
For many illiteracy is linked to poverty
Nnipa pii fam no nhoma a wonnim no fi ohia
At the family level poverty means that people are more concerned with acquiring food for the table than they are in getting an education
Nea ohia de ba abusua so ne aduan a wobedi ho a wodwen kɛse sen nhoma a wobesua
When children are needed at home to work they do not go to school

Many who do go do not continue there

Developing nations burdened with foreign debt are forced to cut back on education

War and civil strife also contribute to illiteracy

Concerning the rural illiterate the book Adult Education for Developing Countries states An adult who has managed without reading and writing is unlikely except in special circumstances to have a burning desire to read and write

Whilst it would be completely false to conclude that he is completely contented with his lot he may not be sufficiently discontented to want to do very much to alter it

It is a challenging task that requires empathy on the part of teachers as well as an understanding of the unique characteristics of the adult learner

Those who teach adults should recognize the differences between adult learners and child learners
Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔkyerɛ mpanyimfo ade no hu nsonsonoe a ɛda asuafo a wɔyɛ mpanyimfo ne wɔn a wɔyɛ mmofra ntam no
Personality habits attitudes and interests are more set in adults than in children making the adult more rigid and less receptive to change

On the other hand adults have rich experiences on which to build and are better able to make sense of facts and concepts that can confuse youngsters
Nanso mpanyimfo wɔ osuahu ahorow a eye a ɛma wotumi nya nkɔso na wotumi te nsɛm ne nkyerɛkyerɛmu ahorow a ebetumi ama mmofra adwene atu afra ase
Usually they do not have as much free time as children do
Ɛtaa ba sɛ wonni bere pii sɛ mmofra
Another very important difference is that adult learners unlike children have the freedom to discontinue their education at any time
Sɛnea wɔnte sɛ mmofra no asuafo a wɔanyinyin no wɔ hokwan sɛ wogyae adesua no bere biara a wɔpɛ
Many adult illiterates possess unique talents and have succeeded in some areas of life they simply have not developed the skills of reading and writing

The literacy teacher needs to encourage them to use the adaptability creativity and endurance they have demonstrated in other areas of life
Ehia sɛ nea ɔkyerɛ wɔn ade no hyɛ wɔn nkuran ma wɔde fakaa a wɔyɛ nneɛma a wotumi yɛ ne boasetɔ a wɔada no adi wɔ nnwuma afoforo bi mu no di dwuma
It takes courage for an illiterate to admit his or her needs and to ask for assistance
Egye akokoduru na obi a onnim akenkan ne akyerɛw agye n’ahiade atom na wahwehwɛ mmoa
Although circumstances and individuals vary many adults approach literacy training with apprehension and a lack of confidence
Ɛwom sɛ ɛsono nsɛm tebea ne ankorankoro biara de nanso mpanyimfo pii de ehu ne ahotoso a wonni na efi ase sua akenkan ne akyerɛw
Some may have a long history of academic failure
Ebia na ebinom mmɔ mmɔden wɔ nhomasua mu fi wɔn mmofraberem
Others may feel that they are too old to learn new things
Afoforo betumi aka sɛ wɔanyinyin dodo sɛ wobesua nneɛma foforo
It is difficult to learn left handedness in old age states a Nigerian proverb
Nigeriafo abebusɛm bi se Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobesua abenkumayɛ wɔ nkwakoraberem anaa mmerewaberem
Teachers can build confidence and sustain interest by being quick to acknowledge and commend progress
Akyerɛkyerɛfo betumi ama wɔanya ahotoso na wɔakɔ so akura wɔn anigye mu denam hwɛ a wɔbɛhwɛ ahu wɔn nkɔso ntɛm na wɔakamfo wɔn no so
Lessons should be structured to minimize learning failure and to ensure repeated successful achievement of learning goals
Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhyehyɛ adesua no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛbɛma ayɛ mmerɛw so na wɔakɔso adu wɔn adesua botae ahorow ho
The publication Educating the Adult states Above all success is probably the single greatest factor in continued motivation
Nhoma Educating the Adult ka sɛ Nea ɛsen ne nyinaa no ebia nkonimdi ne ade titiriw a ɛma obi kɔ so nya nkuranhyɛ
Adults generally know what they want from educational experiences and wish to see immediate progress toward their goals
Mpɛn pii no mpanyimfo nim nea wɔhwehwɛ fi nhomasua mu na wɔpɛ sɛ wonya nkɔso du wɔn botae ahorow ho ntɛmntɛm
One professor of adult education in Africa stated They want to get into class learn what they need to know as quickly as possible then get out
Mpanyimfo nhomasua ho Ɔbenfo bi a ɔwɔ Afrika kae sɛ Wɔpɛ sɛ wofi adesua ase ntɛm sua nea ehia sɛ wohu no ntɛm sɛnea wobetumi biara na wowie
Sometimes the goals a student sets are overly ambitious
Ɛtɔ da bi a botae a osuani bi de si n’ani so no korɔn dodo sɛ obetumi adu ho
From the outset the teacher should help the learner establish intermediate short term goals and then help the student to achieve them
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkyerɛkyerɛni no boa osuani no fi mfiase ma ɔde botae ahorow a wotumi du ho ntɛm sisi n’ani so na afei ɔboa no ma odu ho
For example let us say a Christian enrolls in a literacy class because he or she wants to learn to read the Bible and Bible publications
Sɛ nhwɛso no fa no sɛ Kristoni bi de ne ho hyɛ akenkan ne akyerɛw adesua mu esiane sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ otumi kenkan Bible ne Bible nhoma afoforo nti
These are long term goals
Eyinom yɛ botae ahorow a wontumi nnu ho ntɛm
In working toward them the teacher can encourage the student to set intermediate goals such as mastering the alphabet finding and reading selected scriptures and reading from simplified Bible publications
Wɔ eyi ho dwumadi mu no ɔkyerɛkyerɛni no betumi ahyɛ osuani no nkuran ma ɔde botae ahorow a wotumi du ho ntɛm asisi n’ani so te sɛ kasa mu nkyerɛwde no a obehu din bobɔ kyerɛw nsɛm a wɔbɔ din a obue kenkan ne Bible nhoma a emu yɛ mmerɛw a ɔbɛkenkan
Regularly achieving goals sustains motivation and stimulates the student to keep on learning
Botae ahorow a osuani taa du ho no kɔ so hyɛ no nkuran na ɛkanyan no ma ɔkɔ so sua ade
Effective teachers can do much to stimulate motivation by encouraging and commending their students and by helping them work toward practical achievable goals
Akyerɛkyerɛfo a wɔfata betumi ayɛ pii de akanyan wɔn asuafo ma wɔanya ɔpɛ denam hyɛ a wɔbɛhyɛ wɔn nkuran akamfo wɔn na wɔaboa wɔn ma wɔadu wɔn botae ahorow a ɛfata na ɛnyɛ den ho no so
Yet in order to progress adults should not expect to be spoon fed
Nanso nea ɛbɛyɛ na wɔanya nkɔso no ɛnsɛ sɛ mpanyimfo hwɛ kwan sɛ akyerɛkyerɛfo bɛka biribiara akyerɛ wɔn
They need to be willing to take responsibility for their own education and to work hard at learning
Ɛho hia sɛ wonya ɔpɛ sɛ wobegye wɔn ankasa nhomasua ho asɛyɛde ato wɔn ho so na wɔyere wɔn ho sua ade

Guidelines for Teaching Adults to Read and Write	Akwankyerɛ Ma Wɔn a Wɔkyerɛ Mpanyimfo Ade
It is vital to stimulate motivation in the student
Ɛho hia sɛ wokanyan osuani no ma onya ɔpɛ
From the first session stress the benefits of learning to read and write and encourage the student to set reasonable long and short term goals
Si mfaso a ɛwɔ akenkan ne akyerɛw sua so dua fi adesua a edi kan no so na hyɛ osuani no nkuran ma ɔmfa botae ahorow a wotumi du ho ntɛm ne daakye de nsisi n’ani so
To make progress the student should be instructed several times a week
Sɛ osuani no benya nkɔso a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔkyerɛ no ade mpɛn pii dapɛn mu
Once a week is not enough
Pɛnkoro dapɛn nnɔɔso
The student should do homework between lessons
Ɛsɛ sɛ osuani no sua ade wɔ fie ansa na adesua no bere adu
Do not be overly demanding or overwhelm the student with too much material in one session
Nhwehwɛ nea ɛkyɛn so mfi osuani no hɔ anaasɛ nka nneɛma pii ho nsɛm bere koro mu
This can cause him to become discouraged and stop attending classes
Eyi betumi abu n’abam na wagyae adesua no
Be consistently encouraging and positive
Kɔ so hyɛ no nkuran na nya adwempa
Reading and writing skills are developed in small sequential steps
Wohu akenkan ne akyerɛw nkakrankakra
The student should find satisfaction in his progress
Ɛsɛ sɛ osuani no nya abotɔyam wɔ ne nkɔso ho
Encourage the student to apply as quickly as possible in his daily life what he is learning
Hyɛ osuani no nkuran ma ɔmfa nea ɔresua no nni dwuma wɔ ne da biara da asetram ntɛm sɛnea obetumi biara
Do not waste time on side issues

Adults are busy people
Mpanyimfo yɛ nnipa a wonni adagyew
Make the most of the instruction sessions to teach the essentials

Always be respectful of the student according him the dignity he deserves
Kyerɛ obu ma osuani no bere nyinaa na fa nidi a ɛsɛ no ma no
Never embarrass or belittle him
Nhyɛ no aniwu na mmu no animtiaa da
Be alert to individual problems

A student may be unable to read small print because he needs glasses
Ebia osuani bi ntumi nkenkan nkyerɛwee nketenkete esiane sɛ ohia ahwehwɛniwa nti
Another may be hard of hearing and may thus find it difficult to hear correct pronunciation
Ebia na ɔfoforo nso aso mu yɛ den ma ontumi nte sɛnea wɔbobɔ nsɛm din no yiye
The student should learn the manuscript printed alphabet before attempting cursive writing where letters are joined together
Ɛsɛ sɛ osuani no sua sɛnea obetumi akyerɛw nkyerɛwde a b d no mmiako mmiako atete ntam ansa na wabɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛkyerɛw atoatoam
Manuscript writing is easier to learn and easier to do and the letters more closely resemble those on the printed page
Nkyerɛwde a wɔkyerɛw no mmiako mmiako tete ntam sua ne ne kyerɛw nyɛ den na ɛma ɛyɛ te sɛ nhoma mu nkyerɛwde
A good way to teach how to write letters is to have the student trace them from a pattern
Ɔkwampa a wɔfa so kyerɛ osuani ma otumi kyerɛw nkyerɛwde ne sɛ ɔde bɛfofa nkyerɛwde a wɔakyerɛw dedaw mu
He might trace a letter several times before trying to copy it without tracing it
Obetumi de afofa mu mpɛn pii ansa na wabɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛhwɛ so akyerɛw
Progress in reading is often faster than progress in writing
Ɛtaa ba sɛ wonya nkɔso ntɛmntɛm wɔ akenkan mu sen akyerɛw
Do not delay new reading lessons if the student is not able to perform the homework in writing
Sɛ osuani no ntumi nhuu nkyerɛwde bi kyerɛw a ntwentwɛn wo nan ase sɛ mobɛkɔ akenkan adesua foforo so
On the other hand remember that new letters are learned and remembered more easily if the student practices writing them
Nanso kae sɛ osuani no kɔ so sua nkyerɛwde bi kyerɛw a ɛma ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma no sɛ obesua ma aka ne tirim
Although the adult student may be able to perform intricate tasks with his hands writing with pen or pencil may be a difficult and frustrating experience for him

Literacy Among God s People	Nhomanim Wɔ Onyankopɔn Nkurɔfo Mu
IN ANCIENT times there was a high degree of literacy among God s people
TETE no na Onyankopɔn nkurɔfo nim nhoma yiye
About years ago Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible
Mose kyerɛw Bible nhoma anum a edi kan no bɛyɛ mfe a atwam ni
His successor Joshua was commanded to read the Scriptures day and night in order to be successful in the assignment that God had given him
Wɔhyɛɛ Yosua a odii n’ade no sɛ ɔnkenkan kyerɛwnsɛm no awia ne anadwo sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ebesi no yiye wɔ adwuma a Onyankopɔn de ama no no mu
And God directed that Israelite kings upon ascending the throne write out for themselves a copy of the Law and read in it daily
Joshua Deuteronomy
Afei Onyankopɔn hyɛɛ Israel ahemfo sɛ sɛ wɔbɛtra ahenni agua no so a wɔnkyerɛw Mmara no bi mfa na wɔnkenkan no da biara da
Yosua Deuteronomium
Reading and writing were not limited to the nation s leaders
Na ɛnyɛ ɔman no akannifo no nkutoo na wonim akenkan ne akyerɛw
Though evidently figurative the instruction to the Israelites to write God s commandments upon the doorposts of their houses implied that the people were literate
Ɛwom ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ahyɛde a wɔde maa Israelfo sɛ wɔnkyerɛw ’ Onyankopɔn mmara ngu wɔn afie apongua ho no yɛ sɛnkyerɛnne kwan so adeyɛ de nanso ɛkyerɛ nso sɛ na wonim akenkan ne akyerɛw
Amos was a raiser of sheep and Micah was a prophet from a rural village yet both wrote books of the Bible
Deuteronomy Amos Micah

Jesus had access to all the inspired scrolls of the Hebrew Scriptures in the synagogues where on one occasion he read publicly and applied the text to himself

His apostles also were literate quoting from and referring to the Hebrew Scriptures hundreds of times in their writings

Jesus told his followers to make disciples of people of all the nations
teaching them to observe all the things he had commanded
Yesu ka kyerɛɛ n’asuafo no sɛ wɔnkɔyɛ amanaman nyinaa n’asuafo na wɔnkyerɛkyerɛ wɔn sɛ wonni nea a wahyɛ wɔn nyinaa so

He also foretold that the good news of the kingdom would be preached in all the inhabited earth
Matthew
Ɔka siei nso sɛ wɔbɛka ahenni no ho asɛmpa yi wiase nyinaa
Mateo
Like the Christians in the first century Jehovah s Witnesses today have carried out this commission by zealously teaching and preaching by word of mouth
Te sɛ afeha a edi kan Kristofo no Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ hɔ nnɛ adi saa ahyɛde yi so denam nsi a wɔde ka asɛm na wɔkyerɛkyerɛ no so
They have also spread the Kingdom good news by means of the printed page

Since Jehovah s Witnesses have produced and distributed over nine billion Bibles books magazines and pamphlets in more than languages
Efi reba no Yehowa Adansefo atintim Bible ne nhoma nsɛmma nhoma ne nhomawa ahorow bɛboro ɔpepepem akron wɔ kasa horow bɛboro mu de amema
Millions throughout the earth have responded favorably becoming disciples of Christ

Among them are men and women who neither read nor write

These illiterate ones are not lesser Christians many have served God faithfully for decades endured religious persecution and have shown their love for Jehovah by observing his commandments

At meetings they want to follow the reading of the Bible and Christian publications and they want to read the words of the songs so that they can sing along with their spiritual brothers and sisters

At home they desire to build up themselves and their families through Bible study
Wɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔnam Bible adesua so bɛhyɛ wɔn ho ne wɔn mmusua den wɔ wɔn afie mu
In the ministry they long to teach others the truth of God s Word without relying on someone else to read it for them

Responding to this need Jehovah s Witnesses have arranged to help promote literacy through their congregations and on an individual basis
Wɔ ahiade yi ho dwumadi mu no Yehowa Adansefo hyɛ akenkan ne akyerɛw ho nkuran denam nhyehyɛe a wɔnam ankorankoro ne asafo ahorow so yɛ de boa afoforo no so
Worldwide they have taught countless men and women

The literacy class was conducted by Jehovah s Witnesses
Yehowa Adansefo na wɔyɛɛ akenkan ne akyerɛw ho adesua no ho nhyehyɛe
We used a manual published by the Watch Tower Society and we were given reading assignments to do at home
Na yɛde adesua nhoma a Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no na wotintimii na edi dwuma na na wɔma dwumadi a yɛkɔkenkan no wɔ fie
I felt that my illiteracy was like a sickness
Na mete nka sɛ akenkan ne akyerɛw a minnim no te sɛ yare bi
I wanted to explain the Bible to my brothers and friends but being unable to read and write I could not do that well
Na mepɛ sɛ mede Bible no mu nsɛm kyerɛkyerɛ me nuabarimanom ne nnamfonom nanso esiane sɛ na mintumi nkenkan na mintumi nkyerɛw nti na mintumi nkyerɛkyerɛ wɔn yiye
What motivated me to learn was my desire to preach and to teach others to become Christ s disciples
Nea ɛhyɛɛ me nkuran ma misuaa akenkan ne akyerɛw ne ɔpɛ a na mewɔ sɛ mɛka asɛm no na m’akyerɛkyerɛ afoforo ma wɔabɛyɛ Kristo asuafo no
I wrote on everything I could lay my hands on even on plantain leaves
Na mekyerɛw biribiara a mihu so a borɔde ahaban mpo ka ho
My desire to read and write was so great that I would continue practicing how to read and write in my dreams
Na ɔpɛ a mewɔ sɛ mehu akenkan ne akyerɛw no yɛ kɛse araa ma na meso ho dae
I asked others to help me I was not shy about that
Mesrɛɛ afoforo sɛ wɔmmoa me na memfɛre ho
I remember writing letters to friends and giving the letters to those who went to school to check through
Mekae sɛ na mede krataa a mekyerɛw kɔma nnamfonom mema wɔn a na wɔakɔ sukuu hwɛ mu ma me
It took me a year in the congregation s literacy class to learn
Egyee me afe na mede suaa akenkan ne akyerɛw wɔ asafo no akenkan ne akyerɛw adesua nhyehyɛe no mu
After that I was assigned to teach the class
Ɛno akyi no wɔmaa me kyerɛɛ adesua kuw no mufo ade
That gave me the opportunity to help many others
Ɛno maa minyaa hokwan boaa afoforo pii
That school helped me so much that over the years I was privileged to translate the Society s dramas from English to Isoko my native language
Saa sukuu no boaa me yiye ma minyaa hokwan kyerɛɛ Asafo ti no drama ahorow ase fii Engiresi kasa mu kɔɔ Isoko me kurom kasa mu mfe pii
Apart from that I have served as a congregation overseer since the s
Ɛno akyi no masom sɛ asafo so hwɛfo fi mfe no mu
In the s I served as a substitute traveling overseer of Jehovah s Witnesses
Mesomee sɛ Yehowa Adansefo ɔhwɛfo kwantufo boafo wɔ mfe no mu
I was also privileged to conduct the Pioneer Service School a school for full time ministers and twice to instruct at the Kingdom Ministry School a school for Christian elders
Manya hokwan ahwɛ Akwampaefo Ɔsom Sukuu sukuu a wɔyɛ ma bere nyinaa asomfo so na makyerɛkyerɛ wɔ Ahenni Ɔsom Sukuu sukuu a wɔyɛ ma Kristofo mpanyimfo mprenu
I know that if I were still illiterate all these privileges would not have come my way
Minim sɛ sɛ mansua akenkan ne akyerɛw a anka wɔmfa hokwan ahorow yi nyinaa mma me
How I appreciate this arrangement to teach the lowly ones to read and write !	 Hwɛ sɛnea m’ani sɔ saa nhyehyɛe yi a wɔyɛ de kyerɛ ahobrɛasefo ma wohu akenkan ne akyerɛw no !
Sometimes when I lie down at night I still thank Jehovah that I am no longer an illiterate in this modern world
Sɛ ɛtɔ da bi na mekɔda anadwo a mekɔ so da Yehowa ase sɛ menna so nyɛ obi a onnim akenkan ne akyerɛw wɔ ɛnnɛ wiase yi mu
Our Creator Jehovah God has graciously endowed humankind with the capacity to read and write
Yehowa Nyankopɔn yɛn Bɔfo no de tumi a onipa wɔ sɛ obetumi akenkan akyerɛw adom adesamma
But these skills are not acquired without effort
Nanso egye mmɔdenbɔ na obi de ahu akenkan ne akyerɛw
The greatest reward for learning to read and write is being able to pick up God s Word and obey the divine instruction In an undertone read in it day and night
Joshua
Akatua a ɛsen biara a ɛwɔ akenkan ne akyerɛw sua mu ne sɛ wubetumi afa Onyankopɔn Asɛm no na woadi ɔsoro akwankyerɛ yi so Na kenkan no awia ne anadwo

How to Help Your Children Develop a Love for Reading	Sɛnea Wobɛboa Wo Mma ma Wɔn Ani Agye Akenkan Ho
 Set an example by reading regularly yourself
W’ankasa yɛ nhwɛso denam kenkan a wobɛkenkan daa so
Parents who read are likely to have children who read
Ɛtaa ba sɛ awofo a wɔpɛ akenkan nya mma a wɔpɛ akenkan
Talk to your baby from his infancy
Kasa kyerɛ w’abofra no fi ne mmofraase pɛɛ
Exposure to meaningful language helps children understand words and concepts that will make learning to read easier
Nsɛm a emu da hɔ a mmofra te boa wɔn ma wɔte nsɛmfua ne nsusuwii ahorow a ɛboa ma akenkan sua yɛ mmerɛw ma wɔn ase
Read to your children regularly
Kenkan kyerɛ wo mma daa
When held on the lap and read to infants get the message that words and books are good even when they are not yet old enough to understand the story being read
Sɛ wɔde nkokoaa si mpanyimfo nan so kenkan biribi kyerɛ wɔn a wohu sɛ nsɛmfua ne nhoma ahorow ye bere a wonyinii koraa mpo sɛ wɔbɛte asɛm a wɔkenkan kyerɛ wɔn no ase no
Continue to read to your children after they have learned to read for themselves
Schoolteachers help children learn how to read but parents can do much to help them enjoy reading
Sukuu akyerɛkyerɛfo boa mmofra ma wosua sɛnea wɔkenkan ade nanso awofo betumi ayɛ pii aboa wɔn ma wɔn ani agye akenkan ho
Children enjoy hearing their favorite stories over and over again
Mmofra ani gye ho sɛ wobeti anansesɛm a wɔpɛ no yiye no mu akyerɛ wɔn mpɛn pii
Have books available for your children to read at home
Nya nhoma ma wo mma ma wɔnkenkan wɔ fie
Encourage your children to write
Hyɛ wo mma nkuran ma wɔnkyerɛw ade
A child who writes is usually a reader also
Abofra a ɔtaa kyerɛw ade taa yɛ obi a ɔpɛ akenkan
Choose a definite daily period for family reading
Paw bere pɔtee bi ma abusua no mfa nkenkan ade
Take turns reading and then discuss the material together
Obiara nkenkan bi nnidiso nnidiso na afei munsusuw nea mokenkan no ho
These times should be enjoyable and upbuilding

IT WAS May and World War II had just ended in Europe
NA ƐYƐ May na afei na Wiase Ko II no aba awiei wɔ Europa
I had arrived home in Chojnice Poland only two days before
Na ɛyɛ nnanu pɛ a mebaa fie wɔ Chojnice Poland
The trip had taken almost two months since I had to walk and I had made a number of stops along the way to visit people
Ɛkaa kakra ma anka akwantu no gyee me asram abien efisɛ menantewee na migyinaa mpɛn dodow bi kɔsrasraa nkurɔfo
My previous two years had been spent in the Stutthof concentration camp located near Danzig now Gdansk
Na makodi mfe abien wɔ Stutthof nneduaban a ɛbɛn Danzig mprempren Gdansk no mu
Seated in the living room Mother my two sisters and I were enjoying a visit
Na me ne me nuabeanom baanu akɔsra Maame ma yɛte asa so a yɛn ani agye
There was a knock at the front door and Elaine my oldest sister excused herself to answer it
Obi bɔɔ anim hɔ pon no mu na me nuabea panyin Elaine kae sɛ ɔrekɔhwɛ onii ko
We didn t pay much attention until we heard her scream
Yɛamfa yɛn adwene ankɔ so araa kosi sɛ yɛtee sɛ wateɛm
Immediately I jumped from the chair and ran to the door
Mesɔre fii m’akongua so prɛko pɛ kɔɔ pon no ano ntɛm
There stood Wilhelm Scheider and Manfred Licnierski two fellow Christians who I thought had died soon after I last saw them
Na Wilhelm Scheider ne Manfred Licnierski mfɛfo Adansefo baanu a na misusuw sɛ wɔawuwu fi bere a etwa to a mihuu wɔn no na na wogyina hɔ
After I stared at them for some time in openmouthed disbelief Brother Scheider asked if I was going to invite them in
Metɛɛ m’anom de ahodwiriw hwɛɛ wɔn kakra na Onua Scheider bisae sɛ mɛma wɔn aba dan mu anaa
We spent the rest of the day late into the evening getting reacquainted and recalling how Jehovah God had protected us during our imprisonment
Efi saa bere no yɛtraa ase bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ kosii anadwo na yɛkaakaee sɛnea Yehowa Nyankopɔn bɔɔ yɛn ho ban wɔ yɛn nneduaban mu nna mu no
Before I share some of these experiences let me explain how I came to be in the concentration camp
Ansa na mɛka saa osuahu ahorow yi bi no momma menkyerɛ nea ɛyɛe a wɔde me kɔɔ nneduaban mu no
Faith Tested at an Early Age	Wɔsɔ Me Gyidi Hwɛ wɔ Me Mmofraase
My parents became Bible Students as Jehovah s Witnesses were then called about the time I was born in
M’awofo bɛyɛɛ Bible Asuafo sɛnea na wɔfrɛ Yehowa Adansefo saa bere no na saa bere no ara mu na wɔwoo me
The years leading up to World War II were not easy for Witnesses
Na mfe a edii Wiase Ko II no anim no mu yɛ den ma Adansefo no
The Catholic religion was taught in school and Witnesses were treated harshly
Na wɔkyerɛ Katolek som wɔ sukuu ahorow mu na wodii Adansefo ani kɛse
I was constantly picked on by other children and the teacher would invariably side with the children against me
Na mmofra afoforo taa guan me ho ma ɔkyerɛkyerɛfo no gyina wɔn akyi bere nyinaa
The preaching work was also difficult
Na asɛnka adwuma no nso yɛ den
Once while we were preaching in the nearby town of Kamien at least a hundred townsfolk surrounded about of us Witnesses
Bere bi a yɛreka asɛm wɔ kurow a ɛbɛn Kamien mu no kurow no mufo bɛboro ɔha betwaa Adansefo bɛyɛ a na yɛwɔ hɔ no ho hyiae
Polish soldiers arrived just in time to protect us from the mob
Poland asraafo duu hɔ ntɛm begyee yɛn fii basabasayɛfo kuw no nsam
The persecution intensified when Germany invaded Poland in September
Ɔtaa no mu yɛɛ den bere a Germany to hyɛɛ Poland so wɔ September no
Finally in I was arrested by the Gestapo for refusing to serve in the German Army
Awiei koraa no German polisifo a wɔyɛ adwuma sum ase a wɔfrɛ wɔn Gestapofo no kyeree me wɔ mu esiane sɛ mepowee sɛ mɛsom sɛ German sraani nti
While I was under arrest the Gestapo interrogated me trying to get me to give them the names of other Witnesses in the area
Bere a Gestapofo no kyeree me no wobisabisaa me nsɛm de bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛma mabobɔ mpɔtam hɔ Adansefo afoforo din
When I refused the Gestapo agent told me that I would probably die in a concentration camp
Bere a manyɛ saa no Gestaponi no ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ebia mɛkɔ akowu wɔ nneduaban bi mu
First I was sent to the Chojnice jail where a couple of jailers beat me with a rubber stick trying to force me to compromise my determination to stay loyal to Jehovah
Nea edi kan no wɔde me kɔɔ Chojnice afiase na afiase ahwɛfo bi de rɔba abaa hwee me sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ na magyae me bo a masi sɛ mɛkɔ so adi Yehowa nokware no mu asiesie
This beating went on for or minutes and all the while I was praying fervently
Saa ɔhwe yi kɔɔ so simma anaa na saa bere no nyinaa na merebɔ mpae denneennen
Toward the end of the beating one of the jailers complained that he was going to wear out before I did
Bere a wɔde ɔhwe no rebɛba awiei no afiasehwɛfo biako kae sɛ wabrɛ sen me
Strange as it might seem after the first few blows I really didn t feel them anymore
Ɛyɛ nwonwa de nanso bere a wɔhwee me kakraa bi no afei mante yaw no kɛse bio
Instead it was as if I could only hear them like the beating of a drum off in the distance
Mmom no ɛte sɛ nea na mete ne nnyigyei kɛkɛ te sɛ nea wɔreboro ntwene bi wɔ akyirikyiri
Jehovah definitely protected me and answered my prayers
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ Yehowa bɔɔ me ho ban na otiee me mpaebɔ
News of the beating soon got around the jail and some started calling me a man of God
Ankyɛ na afiase hɔfo no tee hwe a wɔhwee me no ho asɛm na ebinom fii ase frɛɛ me Onyankopɔn nipa
Shortly afterward I was sent to Gestapo headquarters in Danzig
Ɛno akyi no ankyɛ na wɔde me kɔɔ Gestapo adwumayɛbea ti a ɛwɔ Danzig no
A month later I was taken to the Stutthof concentration camp
Ɔsram biako akyi no wɔde me kɔɔ Stutthof nneduaban no mu
Life in Stutthof	M’asetra wɔ Stutthof
Upon arriving we were told to line up in front of the barracks
Bere a wɔde yɛn koduu hɔ no wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ yɛnto santen wɔ nneduaban no anim
A kapo a prisoner given oversight of other prisoners pointed to the three huge smokestacks of the crematorium and told us that in three days we would be in heaven with our God
Obi a ɔyɛ kapo deduani a ɔhwɛ nneduafo afoforo so de ne nsa kyerɛɛ beae a wɔhyew amu no awisikwan akɛse abiɛsa so na ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ ebedi nnansa no na yɛkɔ yɛn Nyankopɔn nkyɛn wɔ soro
I knew that Brother Bruski from our congregation in Chojnice had been sent to Stutthof so I tried to find him
Na minim sɛ wɔde Onua Bruski a na ɔwɔ yɛn asafo a ɛwɔ Chojnice no aba Stutthof enti mebɔɔ mmɔden hwehwɛɛ no
However a fellow prisoner informed me that he had died about a month earlier
Nanso deduani foforo ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ owui ɔsram biako a atwam no
I was so devastated that I actually fell to the ground
Me ho yeraw me araa ma mehwee fam
I felt that if Brother Bruski a physically and spiritually strong Christian had died I certainly would too
Na mete nka sɛ sɛ Onua Bruski a na ɔwɔ honam ne honhom fam ahoɔden mpo awu a ɛnde na me nso mewu
Other prisoners helped me back to the barracks and that is when I first met Brother Scheider
Nneduafo afoforo susoo me mu de me kɔɔ nneduaban atrae hɔ na saa bere no na midii kan huu Onua Scheider
I later learned that before the war he had been Poland s branch overseer
Akyiri yi mibehui sɛ na ɔno ne Poland baa dwumadibea no sohwɛfo ansa na ɔko no refi ase
He had a long talk with me explaining that if I lost faith in Jehovah I would die !	Ɔne me bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ pii na ɔkae sɛ sɛ mehwere Yehowa mu gyidi a mewu !
I felt that Jehovah had sent him to strengthen me
Metee nka sɛ Yehowa na ɔsomaa no sɛ ɔmmɛhyɛ me den
Indeed how true the proverb is that says There is a brother born for when there is distress ! Proverbs
Nokwarem no hwɛ sɛnea abebusɛm yi yɛ nokware sɛ Onua bi wɔ hɔ a wɔwoo no maa hiada ’ ! Mmebusɛm
My faith at that time had weakened and Brother Scheider brought to my attention Hebrews
Saa bere no na me gyidi ayɛ mmerɛw na Onua Scheider twee m’adwene sii Hebrifo so
There Christians are told to beware of the sin that easily entangles them namely lack of faith
Ɛhɔ na wɔka kyerɛ Kristofo sɛ wɔnhwɛ yiye wɔ bɔne a ɛkyekyere wɔn ntɛmntɛm a ɛne gyidi a wonni no ho
He helped me to recall faithful ones spoken of in Hebrews chapter and to analyze my faith in comparison with theirs
Ɔboaa me ma mekaee anokwafo a wɔaka wɔn ho asɛm wɔ Hebrifo ti no de me gyidi totoo wɔn de ho
I stayed as close as possible to Brother Scheider from that time on and although he was years older than I we became very close friends
Efi saa bere no mebɛn Onua Scheider sɛnea metumi biara na ɛmfa ho sɛ na wanyin sen me mfe no yɛbɛyɛɛ nnamfo paa
Once a big fellow wearing a green triangle which meant that he was a criminal told me to get up on a table and preach to the prisoners about Jehovah
Bere bi ɔbarima kɛse bi a na ahinasa a ne hwɛbea te sɛ ahabamono wɔ n’atade mu a ɛkyerɛ sɛ ɔyɛ omumɔyɛfo ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ mensɔre nnyina pon bi so na menka Yehowa ho asɛm nkyerɛ nneduafo no
As I started to do so other prisoners began making fun of me
Bere a mifii ase yɛɛ saa no nneduafo afoforo fii ase dii me ho fɛw
But the big fellow went over and quieted them down everyone was afraid of him
Nanso ɔbarima kɛse no kɔhwɛ maa wɔyɛɛ dinn na obiara suro no
When we assembled to eat at noon and in the evening during the rest of the week this big guy would have me get up on the table to preach
Saa dapɛn no nyinaa sɛ yehyiam sɛ yɛrebedidi owigyinae anaa anwummere a na saa ɔbarima yi ma migyina pon no so ka asɛm no
The following week some of the prisoners including me were assigned to a different barracks
Dapɛn a edi hɔ no wɔde me ne nneduafo afoforo bi kɔɔ nneduaban foforo mu
Another prisoner with a green triangle approached me and asked why my God had sent me to this hell
Odeduani foforo bi a ahinasa a ne hwɛbea te sɛ ahabamono wɔ n’atade mu baa me nkyɛn na obisaa me nea enti a me Nyankopɔn de me aba saa beae a wohu amane wɔ hɔ no
I answered that it was to preach to the prisoners and that being here served to test my faith
Mibuae sɛ wayɛ saa na ama manya kwan aka asɛm akyerɛ nneduafo no na afei asɔ me gyidi ahwɛ
While with these prisoners I was allowed to stand before them and preach every night for two weeks
Bere a me ne saa nneduafo yi wɔ hɔ no wɔmaa me kwan ma migyinaa wɔn anim kaa asɛm no kyerɛɛ wɔn anadwo biara adapɛn abien
One day a kapo told a fellow prisoner to beat me
Da bi kaponi bi ka kyerɛɛ deduani foforo sɛ ɔmmoro me
He refused risking being beaten himself
Ɔpowee ɛmfa ho sɛ na ɛno betumi ama wɔaboro no no
When I asked him why he did not beat me up he said he had been planning to commit suicide but had listened to one of my sermons and it had helped him to change his mind
Bere a mibisaa no nea enti a wammoro me no ɔkae sɛ ɔyɛɛ n’adwene sɛ obekum ne ho nanso me kasa ahorow no biako a otiee no boaa no maa ɔsesaa n’adwene
He figured that I had saved his life and that he couldn t beat someone who had done that
Ɔfaa no sɛ na magye no nkwa ma enti na ontumi mmoro obi a wayɛ saa no

In the winter of the Russians neared Stutthof
Wɔ awɔw bere mu no Russiafo no bɛnee Stutthof
The German camp officials decided to move the prisoners before the Russians arrived
German nneduaban so ahwɛfo yɛɛ wɔn adwene sɛ wobeyi nneduafo no afi hɔ ansa na Russiafo no adu hɔ
The Germans started to march some of us prisoners to S upsk
Germanfo no fii ase maa yɛn mu a yɛwɔ nneduanban no mu tuu aperenten sɛ wɔde yɛn rekɔ S upsk
When we reached the halfway point only some of us remained
Bere a yetwaa kwan no fa no na aka yɛn mu bɛyɛ
Throughout the march we had heard a lot of shooting so apparently the rest had been shot or had escaped
Wɔ aperententu no nyinaa mu no yɛtee atutow pii enti ɛda adi sɛ wɔtotoo wɔn a wɔaka no atuo anaasɛ woguanee
At the beginning of the trek we had each been given a pound g of bread and a half pound g of margarine
Ansa na yɛrefi yɛn akwantu no ase no wɔmaa yɛn mu biara paano a emu duru yɛ gram ne bɔta gram
Many immediately ate all that they were given
Nnipa pii dii nea wɔde maa wɔn no nyinaa ntɛm ara
However I rationed mine as best I could knowing that the trip could last about two weeks
Nanso mekyekyɛɛ me de no mu sɛnea metumi biara efisɛ na minim sɛ yɛde bɛyɛ dapɛn abien na ebetwa kwan no
There were only about ten Witnesses among the prisoners and Brother Scheider and I kept together
Na Adansefo a wɔka nneduafo no ho bɛyɛ du pɛ na me ne Onua Scheider boom nantewee
On the second day of the journey Brother Scheider became sick
Wɔ akwantu no da a ɛto so abien mu no Onua Scheider yaree
From then on I practically had to carry him since if we stopped we would be shot
Efi saa bere no ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ mefa no efisɛ yegyinae a anka wɔbɛto yɛn tuo
Brother Scheider told me that Jehovah had answered his prayers by having me there to assist him
Onua Scheider ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ Yehowa tiee ne mpaebɔ na ɔde me baa hɔ sɛ me mmɛboa no
On the fifth day I was so tired and hungry that I felt I could not go another step let alone carry Brother Scheider
Da a ɛto so anum no na mabrɛ na ɔkɔm de me araa ma metee nka sɛ mintumi ntu anammɔn biako mpo na kampɛsɛ mafa Onua Scheider
He also was getting weaker because of lack of food
Na ɔkɔm ama ɔno nso rekɔ so yɛ mmerɛw
In that early afternoon Brother Scheider told me that he had to relieve himself so I carried him over to a tree
Saa awia no Onua Scheider ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ obegu nsu enti mefaa no de no kɔɔ dua bi ase
I was looking around to make sure that we were not spotted by German guards
Na meretwitwa m’ani ahwɛ ahu sɛ Germanfo awɛmfo no bi nhuu yɛn
After about a minute Brother Scheider turned around with a loaf of bread in his hands
Bɛyɛ simma biako akyi no Onua Scheider danee ne ho a okura paano sebɔw biako
Where did you get that ? I asked
Mibisaa no sɛ Wunya fii he ?
 Was it hanging from the tree or something ? 	Na ɛsɛn dua no so anaasɛ dɛn ? 
He said that while I had my back turned a man approached him and gave him the loaf
Ɔkae sɛ bere a medanee me ho no ɔbarima bi baa ne nkyɛn na ɔde paano no maa no
That seemed remarkable to me since I never saw anyone
Ɛno yɛɛ me ahodwiriw efisɛ manhu obiara wɔ hɔ
At the time we were so hungry we didn t question how it was delivered
Saa bere no na ɔkɔm de yɛn yiye ma yɛansusuw sɛnea ɛyɛe a ɛbae no ho
But I must say that the request Jesus taught us to make for our bread for each day was afterward much more meaningful to me
Nanso nokwarem no efi saa bere no mibenyaa bisa a Yesu kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ yemmisa yɛn daa aduan no ho anisɔ kɛse
We could not have made it another day without that bread
Sɛ yɛannya saa paano no a anka yɛantra ase
I also thought of the psalmist s words I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely nor his offspring looking for bread
Psalm
Misusuw odwontofo no nsɛm yi ho Minhuu Onipa trenee a wɔapa no anaasɛ n’asefo srɛ aduan

After about a week when almost half way to S upsk we stopped at a Hitler Youth camp

There we were to rendezvous with prisoners from other camps

Brother Licnierski had developed typhoid fever and was put in a special barracks with other sick prisoners
Na Onua Licnierski anya atiridii ma wɔde ɔne nneduafo afoforo a wɔyareyare akogu atrae soronko bi mu
Every evening I would sneak out of the barracks I was in and go to Brother Licnierski
Anwummere biara na mifi atrae a mewɔ no wia me ho kɔ Onua Licnierski nkyɛn
If I had been spotted I would have been shot but it was important to me to do what I could to get his fever down
Sɛ wohuu me a anka wɔbɛto me tuo nanso na ɛho hia me yiye sɛ mɛyɛ nea metumi biara ama n’atiridii no abrɛ ase
I would wet a rag and sit by him and wipe his forehead
Na mede ntama bɔ nsu mu tra ne nkyɛn de popa ne moma so
Then I would sneak back to my own barracks
Ɛno akyi no na mesan wia me ho kɔ atrae a mewɔ no
Brother Scheider also developed typhoid fever and was put in the barracks with Brother Licnierski
Onua Scheider nso nyaa atiridii ma wɔde no kɔtoo atrae a Onua Licnierski wɔ no
We were told that the Germans planned to take us to the Baltic Sea load us on a boat and transport us to Denmark
Wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ Germanfo no yɛɛ wɔn adwene sɛ wɔde yɛn bɛkɔ Baltic Po no so na wode yɛn akogu hyɛmma mu de yɛn akɔ Denmark
However the Russians kept getting closer
Nanso Russiafo no kɔɔ so bɛnee
As the Germans grew afraid and began to flee prisoners seized the opportunity to escape
Bere a Germanfo no koma tui na wofii ase guanee no nneduafo no faa hokwan no guanee
The Germans ordered me to leave but since Brother Scheider and Brother Licnierski were too sick to travel and I was unable to carry them I did not know what to do
Germanfo no ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menkɔ nanso esiane sɛ na Onua Scheider ne Onua Licnierski yare dodo sɛ wobetumi atu kwan na mintumi mfa wɔn nti na minhu nea menyɛ
So I left praying that Jehovah would take care of these dear companions
Enti mifii hɔ a na me mpaebɔ ne sɛ Yehowa bɛhwɛ ayɔnkofo adɔfo yi so
An hour after I left the Russians entered the camp
Mifii hɔ akyi dɔnhwerew biako no Russiafo no baa nneduaban no mu
A soldier found Brother Scheider and Brother Licnierski and ordered a German woman who lived at a nearby farm to feed them chicken soup every day until they recovered

The woman told the soldier that the Germans had taken all her chickens
Ɔbea no ka kyerɛɛ ɔsraani no sɛ Germanfo no awia ne nkokɔ nyinaa
He then told her that if she didn t feed these men he would kill her
Afei ɔsraani no ka kyerɛɛ no sɛ sɛ wamma saa mmarima no aduan a obekum no
Needless to say she promptly found some chickens and my dear brothers were on their way to recovery !	Sɛnea wobɛhwɛ kwan no ɔyɛɛ ntɛm kɔhwehwɛɛ nkokɔ na na ɛnkyɛ me nuanom adɔfo yi benya ahoɔden !

While in my mother s living room we talked about these and other experiences until the early hours of the morning
Bere a yɛwɔ me maame asa so no yɛkaa eyinom ne osuahu afoforo ho asɛm kosii ahemadakye
The brothers stayed a couple of days and then moved on to their own homes

Brother Scheider was used mightily by Jehovah to reorganize the preaching activity in Poland resuming many of his former responsibilities

However because of the takeover by the Communists the preaching activity became very difficult

In distinction from the Orthodox faith Jehovah s Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ was not more than God s Son and the holy spirit is God s force or power that is they do not accept the unity of the three in the Holy Trinity

On this day at the International Convention of Jehovah s Witnesses an unprecedented number were baptized namely

In general with such a fine working organization as Jehovah s Witnesses have this religious movement in the near future will surely win over many Orthodox souls who have been in that belief for a long time

When cancer is contained within the breast the malignancy can be removed

This is the most likely cause of death in breast cancer patients

As cancer cells multiply in the breast and the tumor grows in size cancer cells can quietly and secretly exit the primary tumor site and penetrate blood vessel walls and lymph nodes

The Support That Counts	Mmoa A Mfaso Wɔ So
 I HAD to fight the fear of death and periods of depression relates Virginia one of Jehovah s Witnesses in Argentina
VIRGINIA Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ Argentina no biako ka sɛ Na ɛsɛ sɛ migyina owu ho suro ne adwenemhaw ano
She underwent radical mastectomy and removal of both ovaries in her fight against breast cancer
Wɔyɛɛ no oprehyɛn twaa ne nufu ne ɛho ntini ne ne mmadwoa nkotoku abien no nyinaa wɔ nufu mu kokoram ho ayaresa mu
Indeed the fear of death as a consequence of breast cancer is universal
Nokwarem no wosuro wɔ mmaa nyinaa sɛ nufu mu kokoram kowie owu mu
This fear along with a dread of disability and a loss intimately associated with femininity and nurturing capacity can wreak havoc in a woman s life emotionally
Saa osuro yi ne suro a ɔbea wɔ sɛ obedi dɛm na wahwere mmea yɛbea ne abayɛn hokwan a ɔwɔ no betumi ama ne werɛ ahow
Overwhelming feelings of isolation can quickly cause her to spiral into the depths of despair

How can she be spared such emotional battering ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na afoforo betumi aboa no ma wakwati nkate fam ɔhaw yi ?
The Need for Support	Hia a Ɛho Hia sɛ Wɔboa No
 She needs support ! answers Joan from the United States
Joan a ɔwɔ United States no bua sɛ Ohia denhyɛ ! 
Her own mother and grandmother were victims of breast cancer and she now faces the same fight they had
Na n’ankasa maame ne ne nana anya nufu mu kokoram pɛn na na ɔno ankasa nso anya bi
This is a time when loyal family members and friends can provide comforting support and help
Eyi ne bere a abusuafo ne nnamfo anokwafo betumi de denhyɛ ne mmoa ama
Joan s husband Terry became for her a strong positive advocate
Joan kunu Terry bɛyɛɛ ɔboafo pa ankasa
Terry explains My position as I saw it was to be a stabilizing influence
Terry ka sɛ Sɛnea na mihu no no na m’asɛyɛde ne sɛ mɛyɛ okyigyinafo pa
I needed to help Joan to make decisions regarding treatment that would give her confidence and strength to fight and not give up
Na ehia sɛ meboa Joan ma osisi ayaresa ho gyinae ahorow a ɛbɛboa no ma wanya awerɛhyem ne ahoɔden de agyina yare no ano na wampa abaw
Her fear of cancer surgery was something we had to come to grips with and I tried to be sure her questions and fears were addressed in our discussions with the doctors
Yesuaa ɔkwan a yɛbɛfa so agyina osuro a ɔwɔ sɛ wɔbɛyɛ no kokoram ho oprehyɛn no ano na mebɔɔ mmɔden hwɛ hui sɛ yɛne nnuruyɛfo abɔ osuro a ɔwɔ no ho nkɔmmɔ
Terry added This is something we can do for our families and for fellow Christians who do not have family support
Terry de kaa ho sɛ Eyi yɛ ade a yebetumi ayɛ ama yɛn abusuafo ne mfɛfo Kristofo a wonnya abusuafo hɔ mmoa
We can be their eyes ears and voice with the medical personnel

Breast cancer makes an emotional impact on the entire family
Sɛ nufu mu kokoram yɛ obi a ɛma n’abusuafo nyinaa werɛ how
So they are all in need of loving concern and support from others particularly from their spiritual brothers and sisters if they are Jehovah s Witnesses

Although many did not personally agree with the unorthodox treatment my mom chose emotionally they supported us with telephone calls and visits

The elders arranged a telephone linkup so that we would never miss the meetings
Asafo mpanyimfo no yɛɛ nhyehyɛe maa yɛnam telefon so tiee nhyiam horow no sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a emu biara mpa yɛn ti so
The congregation even sent a card with a money gift

Joan admits To this day when I think of the love my spiritual brothers and sisters displayed I get goose bumps !	Joan ka sɛ Ɛnnɛ mpo sɛ misusuw ɔdɔ a me honhom fam anuanom no yii no adi no ho a awɔse gu me !
For seven weeks five days a week my loving sisters would take turns driving me to and from the hospital for treatment

And that was a mile km round trip !	Na na ne kɔ ne ne ba yɛ kilomita !
How I thank Jehovah for the rich blessing of this Christian brotherhood ! 	Meda Yehowa ase dɛn ara sɛ ɔnam saa Kristofo onuayɛ yi so ahyira me kɛse ! 
Another way all of us can be encouraging and supportive is by our upbuilding comments
Ɔkwan foforo a yɛn nyinaa nam so betumi de nkuranhyɛ ne mmoa ama ne nsɛm a ɛma denhyɛ a yɛbɛka

June from South Africa explains One can t expect a person who has not had cancer to say just the right thing
June a ɔwɔ South Africa ka sɛ Wuntumi nhwɛ kwan sɛ obi a kokoram nnyɛɛ no bɛka ho asɛm a ɛfata
In my case I felt it was better for others not to mention cancer cases unless they were positive

Noriko from Japan agrees If people tell me about someone who has recovered and not had a relapse then I too have hope that maybe I will be like them
Noriko a ɔwɔ Japan no ka sɛ Sɛ nkurɔfo ka obi a ne ho tɔɔ no a yare no ansan amma bio ho asɛm a ɛma minya anidaso sɛ ebia me nso me ho bɛtɔ me
Keep in mind that some women would prefer not talking about their health all the time
Kae sɛ mmea binom rempɛ sɛ wɔbɛka wɔn akwahosan ho asɛm bere nyinaa
Others though for the sake of their own well being need to talk about their experience with breast cancer especially with those close to them
Nanso wɔ afoforo fam no esiane wɔn ankasa yiyedi nti ɛho hia sɛ wɔka wɔn nufu mu kokoram no ho asɛm kyerɛ afoforo titiriw wɔn a wɔbɛn wɔn

Working for a Positive Outlook	Adwempa a Wɔbɛbɔ Mmɔden Anya
Breast cancer therapy can leave a patient exhausted and fatigued for weeks months or years
Nufu mu kokoram ho ayaresa tumi ma ɔyarefo no brɛ na ɔyɛ mmerɛw adapɛn asram anaa mfe pii
One of the greatest trials for a woman with breast cancer may be in facing the fact that she can not do as much as before
Ade biako a etumi haw ɔbea a nufu mu kokoram ayɛ no ne nokwasɛm a ɛyɛ sɛ ontumi nyɛ nneɛma pii te sɛ kan no
Coming to terms with her body will mean pacing herself and resting during the day
Ne mmerɛwyɛ ahorow a obegye atom no bɛma wabrɛ ne dwumadi ase na wagye n’ahome awia
When depression sets in quick measures need to be taken to keep a positive attitude
Sɛ obi nya adwenemhaw bi a ɛho hia sɛ ɔyɛ ho biribi ntɛm na ama wanya adwempa
Noriko relates her experience The results of hormone treatment left me depressed
Noriko ka ne suahu Nkwammoa mu nnuru a wɔde saa me yare no ma minyaa adwenemhaw
In this condition I couldn t do the things I wanted and I began feeling useless to Jehovah and in the Christian congregation
Na mintumi nyɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔ saa tebea yi mu na mifii ase tee nka sɛ me so nni mfaso ma Yehowa ne Kristofo asafo no
As my thinking became more negative I would call to mind the final sufferings of those in my family who had died with cancer
Bere a me nsusuwii a ɛnteɛ no kɔ so no na mekae amane a m’abusuafo a kokoram kunkum wɔn no hui ansa na wɔrewuwu
Fear would engulf me as I wondered Can I go through with it as they did ? 	Ɛyɛ a ehu ka me ma mibisa me ho sɛ So metumi agyina ɛyaw no ano te sɛ nea wɔyɛe no ? ’ 
Noriko continues It was at that time that I made an effort to adjust my thinking by using the publications of Jehovah s Witnesses to make myself think of how Jehovah views our existence
Noriko toa so ka sɛ Saa bere no na mebɔɔ mmɔden sɛ mede Yehowa Adansefo nhoma ahorow bedi dwuma de asakra me nsusuwii na mayere me ho asusuw sɛnea Yehowa bu nkwa mu a yɛwɔ no
I learned that godly devotion is shown not by the amount of work done but by the motive in which it is done
Misua hui sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma dodow a wɔyɛ so na wɔnam da onyamesom pa adi na mmom adwene nti a wɔyɛ saa no
As I wanted Jehovah to take pleasure in the condition of my heart and my thinking I decided that I should serve him with joy and be whole souled even if I could only do a little in the Christian ministry
Esiane sɛ na mepɛ sɛ Yehowa ani sɔ me komam tebea ne me nsusuwii nti meyɛɛ m’adwene sɛ mefi anigye ne koma nyinaa mu asom no ɛmfa ho sɛ ebia mintumi nyɛ pii wɔ Kristofo som adwuma no mu no

She especially encourages Tell others about God s Kingdom
Ɔhyɛ nkuran kɛse sɛ Ka Onyankopɔn Ahenni no ho asɛm kyerɛ afoforo
And cultivate a real longing for the conditions that will prevail on earth under the Kingdom where there will be no more sickness ! Matthew

As for the times when critical moments come and fear wells up she says I put my full trust in Jehovah knowing that he will never abandon me
Ɛdefa bere a tebea no mu yɛ den ma osuro kyekyere no ho no ɔka sɛ Mede me ho to Yehowa so korakora a minim sɛ ɔrennyaw me da
And I think about the Bible verse at Psalm which assures me that I will walk before Jehovah in the lands of those living
Na misusuw kyerɛwsɛm a ɛwɔ Dwom no a ɛma minya awerɛhyem yi ho sɛ mɛnantew Yehowa anim ateasefo asase so

All these women have centered their hope upon the God of the Bible Jehovah
Saa mmea yi nyinaa de wɔn werɛ ahyɛ Bible no Nyankopɔn Yehowa mu
The Bible book of Corinthians at chapter verses and calls Jehovah the God of all comfort who comforts us in all our tribulation
Bible mu nhoma a ɛne Korintofo ti nkyekyem ne frɛ Yehowa awerɛkyekye nyinaa Nyankopɔn a ɔkyekye yɛn werɛ yɛn ahohia nyinaa mu
Does Jehovah stretch out his hand to support those needing comfort ?	So Yehowa di boa wɔn a wohia awerɛkyekye ?
Mieko from Japan answers I am convinced that by staying in his service I receive Jehovah s strong comfort and help
Mieko a ɔwɔ Japan bua sɛ Migye di sɛ menam Yehowa som a mekɔ so tra mu no so nya awerɛkyekye ne mmoa
Yoshiko also tells us Although people may not understand my suffering Jehovah knows everything and I am convinced that he has helped according to my needs

Can you imagine a world without breast cancer in fact without any illnesses at all ?	Wubetumi ayɛ wiase a nufu mu kokoram ne ɔyare foforo biara nnim ho mfonini ?
This is the promise made by the God of all comfort Jehovah

Isaiah speaks about a time when no person on earth will ever say that he or she is sick
Yesaia ka sɛ bere bi bɛba a asase so nipa biara renka sɛ ɔyare
That hope will soon be realized when God s Kingdom in the hands of his Son Christ Jesus brings its full rule to the earth wiping away all causes for sickness sorrow and death !

M’awofo tetee me ma mebɛyɛɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako na wɔde Onyankopɔn mmara hyɛɛ me komam fi me mmofraase
I cannot remember a time when I was not going to meetings and conventions of Jehovah s Witnesses
Mantoto Yehowa Adansefo nhyiam nketewa ne akɛse no ase da
And as a young girl I also went with older Witnesses to call on people to help them learn about the Bible s hope of eternal life on a paradise earth under the rule of God s Kingdom

My grandfather listened to the same lecture and he too was convinced that what he heard was the truth

How encouraging it is to see two of those men still serving as elders in the congregation !	Hwɛ nkuranhyɛ a ɛyɛ sɛ yebehu sɛ saa mmarima yi baanu da so ara som sɛ mpanyimfo wɔ asafo no mu !
My brother later served at Brooklyn Bethel the world headquarters of Jehovah s Witnesses in New York and is still serving as an elder in our hometown of Millville New Jersey

Those war years were very difficult in the United States as elsewhere for Jehovah s Witnesses

Thousands of our spiritual brothers went to prison so we women had to perform various congregation duties
Wɔde honhom fam anuanom mmarima mpempem pii koguu afiase enti na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn mmea no yɛ asafo mu dwumadi ahorow no
That s why at an early age I was the literature servant
Ɛno nti bere a na misua koraa no mesomee sɛ nhoma sohwɛfo
With Jehovah s help we survived the difficult war years and when the brothers came back from prison things moved forward
Ɛdenam Yehowa mmoa so no yetumi gyinaa ɔko mfe no mu nsɛnnennen no ano na bere a anuanom fi afiase san bae no nkɔanim bae
It was at this time that Lyman Swingle from Bethel visited our congregation
Saa bere no na Lyman Swingle fi Betel bɛsraa yɛn asafo no
He encouraged me to come to Brooklyn and help in the relief efforts being made in behalf of our fellow Witnesses in Europe following World War II
Ɔhyɛɛ me nkuran sɛ memmra Brooklyn na memmenya mmoa a wɔde ma mfɛfo Adansefo a wɔwɔ Europa wɔ Wiase Ko II no akyi no mu kyɛfa
So it was that in March I went to Brooklyn
Ɛno nti wɔ March no mekɔɔ Brooklyn
Happy Years in a New Congregation	Minya Anigye wɔ Asafo Foforo Mu
I was assigned to my new congregation Brooklyn Center
Wɔde me kɔɔ Brooklyn Center asafo mu
It was the very first congregation formed in New York City and adjacent areas before World War I although under a different name
Ɛno ne asafo a edi kan a wɔtewee wɔ New York City ne ne mpɔtam hɔ ansa na Wiase Ko I reba ɛwom sɛ saa bere no na wɔmfrɛ no saa de
At that time it was located in the Brooklyn Heights area
Saa bere no de na ɛwɔ Brooklyn Heights mpɔtam hɔ
But when I came to Brooklyn Center in it was at th Avenue and th Street in Brooklyn
Nanso bere a mekɔɔ Brooklyn Center wɔ mu no na ɛwɔ th Avenue ne th Street ntam wɔ Brooklyn
For nearly years that rented location served as our meeting place until a new hall was purchased a short distance away
Bɛyɛ mfe no na yehyiam wɔ saa dan a yɛahan no mu kosi sɛ yɛtɔɔ asa foforo wɔ ɛno nkyɛn pɛɛ
I will never forget my first day in the preaching work in Brooklyn on Henry Street
Me werɛ mfi ɛda a edi kan a mekɔɔ asɛnka wɔ Brooklyn no da wɔ Henry Street
It was quite a change from witnessing in a small town
Na ɛyɛ soronko koraa fi kurow ketewa mu adansedi ho
But soon I met a young woman who accepted Bible literature and agreed to a home Bible study
Nanso ankyɛ na mihyiaa ababaa bi ma ogyee Bible nhoma na ɔpenee so sɛ me ne no mmɛyɛ ofie Bible adesua
In time she became a dedicated servant of Jehovah as did two of her children
Akyiri yi ɔbɛyɛɛ Yehowa somfo a wahyira ne ho so na ne mma baanu nso yɛɛ saa
Her son Arthur Iannone is currently serving at Brooklyn Bethel with his wife Linda along with their son and daughter in law
Mprempren ne babarima Arthur Iannone ne ne yere Linda ne wɔn babarima ne ne yere nyinaa resom wɔ Brooklyn Betel
The congregation s territory where we preached was large and fruitful
Na asafo no asasesin yɛ kɛse na ɛsow aba
With Jehovah s help I was able to see many of my Bible students learn the truth and get baptized
Ɛdenam Yehowa mmoa so no mitumi boaa me Bible asuafo no pii ma wosuaa nokware no gyee asubɔ
To this day some are serving as full time ministers in this country
Ebesi nnɛ no wɔn mu bi yɛ bere nyinaa asomfo wɔ ɔman yi mu
Others are missionaries in distant lands
Afoforo nso yɛ asɛmpatrɛwfo wɔ akyirikyiri nsase so
Some became elders in congregations

And many have served in other capacities as faithful proclaimers of the good news of God s Kingdom

The growth was amazing

Where originally there was just one congregation for New York City and the surrounding area now there are nearly in New York City alone

French Speaking Interest Blossoms	Wɔn a Wɔka Franse Kasa no Anigye yɛ Kɛse
In the s we began to find many French speaking people in the congregation s territory who had moved from Haiti
Wɔ mfe no mu no yefii ase huu nnipa a wofi Haiti aba yɛn asafo no asasesin mu a wɔka Franse kasa
Most spoke limited English or none at all
Na wɔn mu dodow no ara te Engiresi kakraa bi anaa wɔnte koraa
Here was a challenge
Na ɛyɛ asɛnnennen
How could we help them learn more about the Bible ?	Na yɛbɛyɛ dɛn aboa wɔn ma wɔanya Bible nimdeɛ pii ?
I did not speak French but with an English copy of a basic Bible textbook in one hand and the French translation of that book in the other I was able to conduct Bible studies
Na mente Franse kasa nanso bere a mikura Bible nhoma titiriw a na yɛde di dwuma saa bere no Nokware a Ɛde Kɔ Daa Nkwa Mu Engiresi de ne Franse kasa mu de nyinaa no mitumi yɛɛ Bible adesua ahorow
However there were no meetings in French to help these people grow spiritually
Nanso na wɔnyɛ nhyiam biara wɔ Franse kasa mu na aboa saa nnipa yi ma wɔanyin wɔ honhom mu
That s why any Witness missionary who visited Brooklyn and could speak French was immediately asked to help
Ɛno nti sɛ Ɔdansefo a ɔyɛ ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo biara a ɔte Franse kasa ba hɔ a ntɛm ara wɔma no bɛboa
One of the first to come to our aid was Nicolas Brisart who is the coordinator of the Branch Committee in Guadeloupe
Wɔn a wodii kan bɛboaa yɛn no biako ne Nicolas Brisart a mprempren ɔyɛ Guadeloupe Baa Boayikuw kyerɛwfo no
He gave our first public talk in French at the home of Sister Bertha Luisdon who is still faithfully serving Jehovah
Ɔno na ɔmaa baguam ɔkasa a edi kan wɔ Franse kasa mu wɔ Onua Bertha Luisdon a ɔda so de nokwaredi resom Yehowa fie
Twenty seven persons were in attendance
Nnipa aduonu ason na wobetiei
Still at that time aside from Spanish there were no foreign language congregations in New York City
Ne nyinaa akyi no na asafo ahorow a wɔka amannɔnefo kasa biara nni New York City ka Spania ho
So the idea of establishing an official French speaking congregation was hard even to imagine
Enti na adwene bi nni hɔ sɛ wɔbɛtew asafo a wɔka Franse kasa
In fact a traveling overseer made things look even more bleak when he informed us that the policy at that time was to encourage people living in this country to learn English
Nokwarem no ɔhwɛfo kwantufo bi maa yɛhweree anidaso koraa bere a ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛwɔ hɔ saa bere no ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhyɛ nkurɔfo a wɔtete saa man yi mu nkuran ma wosua Engiresi kasa no
Brother Fred W
Onua Fred W
Franz who later became president of the Watch Tower Society was a source of encouragement
Franz a akyiri yi ɔbɛyɛɛ Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no titrani no de nkuranhyɛ mae
He said If it is Jehovah s will Mary there will be a French Congregation
Ɔkae sɛ Mary sɛ ɛyɛ Yehowa pɛ a wobenya Franse Kasa mu Asafo
Also encouraging was Brother Harry Peloyan the presiding overseer of Brooklyn Center Congregation
Na onua Harry Peloyan Brooklyn Center Asafo no ɔhwɛfo guamtrani nso hyɛ nkuran
He said that on evenings when the Kingdom Hall was not in use we could have an unofficial Congregation Book Study and public talks whenever a visitor came who could speak French
Ɔkaee sɛ bere biara a yebenya ɔhɔho a ɔte Franse kasa no yebetumi aba Ahenni Asa no so anwummere a wɔnyɛ nhyiam biara wɔ hɔ no na yɛabɛyɛ Asafo Nhoma Adesua ne baguam ɔkasa ahorow a ɛnka Asafo ti no nhyehyɛe ho
By this time we had a number of baptized brothers from Haiti who had moved here but there was still no one experienced enough to take the organizational lead in the French language
Ebesi saa bere no na anuanom a wɔabɔ wɔn asu kakra fi Haiti atu abɛtra ha nanso na wɔn mu biara ho nkokwawee sɛ obetumi adi Franse kasa mu asafo anim
Then Brother Timothy Galfas who was schooled in Paris and was now a member of the Brooklyn Bethel family learned of our situation
Afei Onua Timothy Galfas a ɔkɔɔ sukuu wɔ Paris a saa bere no na ɔka Brooklyn Betel abusua no ho huu yɛn tebea no
Every Saturday after working at Bethel he would come out and we would search for Haitian brothers and sisters who were living here but who did not know where to associate
Memeneda biara sɛ ɔpɔn adwuma wɔ Betel a na ɔba ma yɛkɔhwehwɛ anuanom mmarima ne mmea a wofi Haiti a wɔabɛtra ha nanso wonhu asafo a wɔne wɔn mmɔ no
Soon we had about persons associating with us
Ankyɛ na yenyaa bɛyɛ nnipa kaa yɛn ho
We asked our circuit overseer to write the Society to give us approval for an official Congregation Book Study in French
Yɛka kyerɛɛ ɔmansin sohwɛfo no sɛ ɔnkyerɛw asafo ti no na wɔmma yɛn hokwan ma yɛnyɛ Franse kasa mu Nhoma Adesua nyɛ ho kyerɛwtohɔ
How pleased we were when this was granted !	Hwɛ sɛnea yɛn ani gyei bere a wɔmaa yɛn hokwan no !
Later we also got permission to have regular public talks and a weekly Watchtower Study

On December we received approval to establish a French speaking congregation the first in the United States
Wɔ December no wɔmaa yɛn kwan sɛ yɛnhyehyɛ Franse kasa mu asafo a ɛno ne nea edi kan wɔ United States
It would share the Kingdom Hall with the Brooklyn Center and Prospect congregations
Na wɔne Brooklyn Center ne Prospect Asafo no bɛkɔ Ahenni Asa koro mu
We were thrilled !	Yedii ahurusi !
We knew that all would make greater spiritual advancement in the language they understood
Na yenim sɛ obiara benya honhom mu nkɔso kɛse wɔ kasa a ɔte no mu
Much appreciated during all those years of our growing pains was the support of such brothers as Harry Peloyan George Haddad and Carlos Quiles who formed the Brooklyn Center service committee
Wɔ saa mfe a yedii awerɛhow yi nyinaa mu no yɛn ani sɔɔ anuanom te sɛ Harry Peloyan George Haddad ne Carlos Quiles a na wɔn na wɔyɛ Brooklyn Center Asafo no boayikuw no mmoa kɛse
We grew quickly

Soon new French congregations were formed in Manhattan Queens and Nyack New York
Ankyɛ na wɔtetew Franse kasa mu asafo ahorow wɔ Manhattan Queens ne Nyack New York
Helping in this expansion were Jeff Keltz and Tom Cecil of Brooklyn Bethel
Nnipa a wɔboaa saa nkɔso yi ne Jeff Keltz ne Tom Cecil a wɔwɔ Brooklyn Betel no

In fact we had our first circuit assembly in French in April

It was also a thrill when in we were allowed to use the Jersey City Assembly Hall of Jehovah s Witnesses for our district convention

We sisters always took time to discuss a Scripture text to start our day then we went to our secular work and in the ministry

But she became a full time minister and later attended Gilead school serving many years in Ecuador

It has also been a source of joy for me to become acquainted with many Witnesses from other lands

For instance since we lived near the Society s headquarters we had the privilege of associating with students attending the Gilead missionary school then located at Brooklyn Bethel
Sɛ nhwɛso no esiane sɛ na yɛte bɛn Asafo ti no adwumayɛbea ti hɔ nti yenyaa hokwan ne adesuafo a wɔbaa Gilead asɛmpatrɛw sukuu wɔ Brooklyn Betel no bɔe

In reflecting on my life I can say that it has been wonderful a happy life full of blessings
Sɛ midwen m’asetra ho a metumi aka sɛ ayɛ nea anigye wom asetra a ahomeka ne nhyira pii wom
While I have had many of the usual problems that come with this system of things nothing has ever caused me to regret my past or to give up the precious privilege of full time service

At an early age my mother instilled in me the words of Psalm Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry
Bere a meyɛ abofra no me maame de nsɛm a ɛwɔ Dwom yi duaa me mu Wɔn a wɔde nusu gu de ahurusi betwa
The one that without fail goes forth even weeping carrying along a bagful of seed will without fail come in with a joyful cry carrying along his sheaves
Ɔde nusu nennam kura aba a wogu ɔde ahurusi kura n’afiafi bɛba
That scripture still serves as a guide for me
Meda so di saa kyerɛwsɛm no so
No matter what the problems were Jehovah helped me to find a way to overcome them and maintain that joy
Ɛmfa ho nsɛnnennen ko a mihyiae no Yehowa boaa me ma minyaa ɔkwan a mɛfa so adi so na makora saa anigye no so
My life is one that I surely would not want to change

I have no regrets in giving some years to Jehovah in the full time ministry

The Bible s Viewpoint	Bible no Adwene
Is It Always Wrong to Get Angry ?	Bere Nyinaa na Ɛyɛ Mfomso sɛ Obi Bo Befuw Anaa ?
 ANGER is a short madness
ABUFUW yɛ bere tiaa mu adammɔ
Thus the ancient Roman poet Horace Latin Horatius voiced a common view of one of the strongest of all emotions
Saa na Romani anwensɛm kyerɛwfo Horace kae wɔ adwene a nnipa pii wɔ wɔ nnipa nkate horow a ano yɛ den sen biara no biako ho
While not everyone agrees that anger is a form of temporary insanity many do view it as inherently bad
Ɛmfa ho sɛ ɛnyɛ obiara na ogye tom sɛ abufuw yɛ bere tiaa mu adammɔ no nnipa pii bu no sɛ enye koraa
As early as the sixth century C
E
Catholic monks compiled the famous catalog of seven deadly sins
Wɔ afeha a ɛto so asia Y
B
mu tɔnn no Katolek nkokorafo kyerɛwee bɔne a anibere wom ason ho nhoma a agye din no
Anger not surprisingly made that list
Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ abufuw ka ho
It is easy to see why they felt this way
Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wubehu nea enti a na wɔte nka saa
The Bible does say Let anger alone and leave rage
Bible no se Ma abufuw ntwa na gyae bo bɔne yɛ
And the apostle Paul exhorted the congregation at Ephesus Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness
Ephesians
Afei nso ɔsomafo Paulo tuu Efeso asafo no fo sɛ Momma wonyi anobow nyinaa ne bobɔne ne abufuw ne ano kurokuro ne abususɛm ɛne bɔnepɛ nyinaa mfi mo mu
Efesofo
You might well wonder though Is that all there is to the Bible s viewpoint on anger ?	Nanso ebia wubebisa sɛ So ɛno ara ne nea Bible no ka fa abufuw ho ?
After all did not Paul also prophesy that these last days in which we live would be critical times hard to deal with ? 	Anyɛ yiye koraa no so Paulo nso anhyɛ nkɔm sɛ saa nna a edi akyiri a yɛwɔ mu yi bɛyɛ mmere a emu yɛ den ? ’
Does God really expect us to live in these times when people are fierce without love of goodness with no natural affection and never become even a little angry ?	 Timote So Onyankopɔn hwɛ kwan ankasa sɛ yɛbɛtra ase wɔ saa mmere a nnipa yɛ keka wɔmpɛ papa wonni dɔ ’ yi mu a yɛn bo mfuw kakra mpo ?
A Balanced View	Adwene a Ɛkari Pɛ
The Bible s treatment of this subject is not so simplistic
Bible no nka abufuw ho asɛm te sɛ nea ɛso di yɛ mmerɛw
Notice for example Paul s words at Ephesians Be wrathful and yet do not sin
Sɛ nhwɛso no hyɛ Paulo nsɛm a ɛwɔ Efesofo yi nsow Mo bo mfuw na monnyɛ bɔne ! 
This verse would be quite puzzling if anger were automatically a deadly sin one meriting eternal punishment
Sɛ abufuw biara yɛ bɔne a anibere wom a ɛfata daa asotwe a anka saa nkyekyem yi asete bɛyɛ den yiye
Paul was quoting from Psalm which reads Be agitated but do not sin
Paulo faa Dwom mu asɛm a ɛkenkan sɛɛ yi kae sɛ Mo bo nhuru na monnyɛ bɔne ! ’
According to Vine s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words the Hebrew word translated here be agitated ra ghaz means to quiver with strong emotion
Sɛnea Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words kyerɛ no Hebri asɛmfua a wɔkyerɛ ase wɔ ha sɛ mo bo nhuru ra ghaz kyerɛ nkate a emu yɛ den a ɛkanyan obi
But which strong emotion ?	Nanso ɛyɛ dɛn nkate ?
Was it anger ?	Abufuw anaa ?
In the Septuagint translation of Psalm ra ghaz was rendered in Greek as be made wrathful and that is clearly what Paul intended here
Wɔ Septuagint no mu no wɔkyerɛɛ ra ghaz ase wɔ Dwom ase sɛ mo bo mfuw na ɛda adi sɛ ɛno na na Paulo kyerɛ wɔ ha
Why would the Bible allow a place for anger ?	Dɛn nti na Bible no betumi ama abufuw bi ho kwan ?
Because not all anger is bad
Efisɛ ɛnyɛ abufuw nyinaa na enye
The view that as one Bible commentator put it man s anger is never in itself just and permissible is not Scriptural
Adwene a ɛte sɛ nea Bible nhoma kyerɛwfo bi kaa ho asɛm sɛ onipa abufuw nteɛ ɔkwan biara so na wɔmma hokwan da no nnyina Kyerɛwnsɛm so

Lenski rightly remarked on Ephesians The ethics which forbids all anger and demands unruffled calmness in every situation is Stoic and not Christian
Lenski kaa Efesofo ho asɛm yiye sɛɛ Abrabɔ nnyinasosɛm biara a ɛbara abufuw biara na ɛhwehwɛ kommyɛ korakora wɔ tebea biara mu no yɛ Stoafo adeyɛ ɛnyɛ Kristofo adeyɛ
Professor William Barclay similarly noted There must be anger in the Christian life but it must be the right kind of anger
Saa ara na Ɔbenfo William Barclay kae sɛ Ɛsɛ sɛ abufuw ba Kristofo asetra mu nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ abufuw a ɛteɛ
But what is the right kind of anger ?	Nanso dɛn ne abufuw a ɛteɛ ?
Righteous Anger	Abufuw a Ɛteɛ
While anger is not one of his dominant qualities Jehovah is repeatedly described in the Scriptures as feeling and expressing his anger
Bere a abufuw nka Yehowa su atitiriw no ho no Kyerɛwnsɛm no ka ne ho asɛm mpɛn pii sɛ ɔfa abufuw na ɔda n’abufuw adi
For two reasons though his rage is always righteous
Nanso nneɛma abien nti n’abufuw teɛ bere nyinaa
One he never gets angry without a proper basis
Nea edi kan ne sɛ ne bo mfuw a ntease pa biara nnim da
And two he expresses his anger in a just and righteous way never losing control
Exodus Psalm
Na nea ɛto so abien no ɔda n’abufuw adi wɔ ɔkwan a ɛfata na ɛteɛ so na odi ne ho so bere nyinaa
Exodus Dwom
Jehovah is enraged by deliberate unrighteousness
Bɔne a wɔhyɛ da yɛ hyɛ Yehowa abufuw
For example he told the Israelites that if they victimized defenseless women and children he would unfailingly hear the outcry of such ones
Sɛ nhwɛso no ɔka kyerɛɛ Israelfo no sɛ sɛ wosisi mmea ne mmofra a wontumi mmɔ wɔn ho ban a tie na obetie ’ saafo no
He warned My anger will indeed blaze
Ɔbɔɔ kɔkɔ sɛ M’abufuw ano bɛyɛ den
’
Like his Father Jesus had a soft place in his heart for children
Te sɛ n’Agya no na Yesu fi komam wɔ ayamhyehye ma mmofra
When his well meaning followers once tried to prevent some children from approaching him Jesus was indignant and took the children into his arms
Bere bi a n’akyidifo a wonni adwemmɔne biara no bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔmma mmofra bi kwan mma wɔmma ne nkyɛn no Yesu bo fuwii na ɔbam mmofra no
Notably the Greek word for indignant originally referred to physical pain or irritation
Nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛhyɛ no nsow no mfiase no na Hela asɛmfua a wɔkyerɛ ase abufuw ’ no kyerɛ honam fam yaw anaa ɔhaw
Strong feelings indeed !	Na ɔwɔ nkate a emu yɛ den ankasa !
Righteous indignation likewise stirred in Jesus heart when he saw that merchants and money changers had turned his Father s house of worship into a cave of robbers
Saa ara na trenee abufuw kanyan Yesu wɔ ne komam bere a ohui sɛ aguadifo ne sika sesafo adan n’Agya asɔrefie hɔ adwowtwafo tu no
He upset their tables and threw them out of there !	Ɔkaa wɔn apon butuwii na ɔpam wɔn fii hɔ !
When the Pharisees and the scribes showed more concern for their niggling Sabbath rules than for the sick who needed help Jesus was deeply hurt as he sensed their inhumanity and looked round in anger at the faces surrounding him
Mark Phillips
Bere a Farisifo ne akyerɛwfo no maa wɔn Homeda ho mmara a ɛso nni mfaso no hiaa wɔn sen ayarefo a na wohia mmoa no ɛyɛɛ Yesu yaw kɛse bere a ohuu wɔn komaden no na ɔde abufuw hwɛɛ wɔn a wɔatwa ne ho ahyia no anim
Marko Phillips
Similarly faithful Moses of old was filled with righteous indignation at the disloyal Israelites when he hurled down the tablets of the Mosaic Law
Saa pɛpɛɛpɛ na na Israelfo a wɔanni nokware no ho abufuw a ɛteɛ ahyɛ ɔnokwafo Mose a ɔtraa ase tete mmere mu no ma bere a ɔde Mose Mmara pon no hwee fam no
And the righteous scribe Ezra was so angry over the Israelites disobedience to God s law on marriage that he tore his garments and even pulled some of his hair out ! Ezra
Na ɔkyerɛwfo a ɔteɛ Esra bo fuwii wɔ Israelfo asoɔden a wɔyɛe wɔ Onyankopɔn mmara a ɛfa aware ho no ho araa maa osunsuanee n’atade mu na otutuu ne ti so nhwi bi mpo no ! Esra
All of those who love what is good strive to hate what is bad
Wɔn a wɔdɔ papa ’ nyinaa bɔ mmɔden tan bɔne
’
Thus Christians today may feel righteous anger welling up in their hearts when they see deliberate unrepentant acts of cruelty hypocrisy dishonesty disloyalty or injustice
Enti ɛnnɛ Kristofo betumi ate abohuru nka wɔ wɔn komam bere a wohu atirimɔdenne a wɔhyɛ da yɛ a wɔnkyerɛ ahonu nyaatwomyɛ atosɛm nokware a wonni anaa nsisi no
Handling Anger Properly	Abufuw a Wobedi ho Dwuma Ɔkwampa So
It is no accident that the Bible often likens anger to a fire
Ntease pa bi wɔ hɔ a enti Bible no de abufuw toto ogya ho
Like fire it has its place
Te sɛ ogya no ɛwɔ ne bere a ɛfata
But it can also be horrendously destructive
Nanso ebetumi asɛe ade kɛse nso
All too often unlike Jehovah and Jesus humans feel anger without proper basis or express their anger in an unrighteous way
See Genesis Jonah
Mpɛn pii no nea ɛnte sɛ Yehowa ne Yesu no nnipa bo fuw a ntease pa biara nnim anaa wɔda wɔn abufuw adi ɔkwan a ɛnteɛ so
Hwɛ Genesis Yona
On the other hand simply bottling up one s anger and pretending it is not there may not be righteous either
Saa ara na ebia obi abufuw a ɔbɛka ahyɛ kɛkɛ na wayɛ ne ho te sɛ nea ne bo mfuwii no nso nteɛ
Remember Paul counseled Let the sun not set with you in a provoked state
Kae sɛ Paulo tuu fo sɛ Mommma owia nnkɔtɔ mo abufuw so
There are Scriptural ways to express anger such as having your say in your heart talking out your feelings with a mature confidant or even calmly confronting a wrongdoer
Psalm Proverbs Matthew James
Akwan a wubetumi ada w’abufuw adi a ɛne Kyerɛwnsɛm no hyia wɔ hɔ te sɛ wo komam a wobɛkasa ’ sɛnea wote nka a wobɛka akyerɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw a wowɔ ne mu ahotoso anaa nea wayɛ bɔne no a wobɛkɔ ne nkyɛn wɔ odwo mu
Dwom Mmebusɛm Mateo Yakobo
Therefore it most decidedly is not always wrong to get angry
Enti ɛda adi pefee sɛ ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ obi bo befuw
Both Jehovah and Jesus have got angry and will again !	Yehowa ne Yesu nyinaa bo afuw pɛn na wɔn bo bɛsan afuw !
If we are to imitate them we may even face situations wherein it is wrong not to feel angry !	Sɛ yesuasua wɔn a yebetumi ahyia tebea horow mpo a ɛbɛyɛ mfomso sɛ yɛmma yɛn bo mfuw !
The key will be to follow Bible counsel making sure that we have a valid basis for our feelings and that we express them in a righteous Christian manner
Ade a ɛboboa ne sɛ yebedi Bible afotu akyi na yɛahwɛ ahu sɛ yɛwɔ ntease pa a enti yɛn bo afuw na afei yɛda no adi wɔ ɔkwan a ɛteɛ Kristofo kwan so

So if anyone is feeling depressed or anxious it is advisable that he not suffer alone
Enti sɛ adwenemhaw anaa dadwen rehaw obi a ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ ɔno nkutoo nni ho yaw
The sufferer can pour out his heart to a person he trusts
Nea ɔrehu amane no betumi ayi ne yam aka ne nkate akyerɛ obi a ɔwɔ ne mu ahotoso
Talking to someone helps diminish the intensity of one s emotions and it may give one a fresh perspective on the problems
Obi a wobɛka ho asɛm akyerɛ no no bɛboa ma wo nkate mu yaw no so atew na ebetumi ama woanya ɔhaw no ho adwene foforo
If someone is heartbroken over losing a friend or a loved one in death that one should talk it over with a confidant
Sɛ adamfo anaa obi a wɔdɔ no wu ma obi koma botow a ɛsɛ sɛ onii no ka ho asɛm kyerɛ obi a ɔwɔ ne mu ahotoso
When the pain of such losses is acknowledged and grief is felt a person is comforted
Sɛ onii no gye n’adehwere a ɛte saa tom na odi ho yaw a nea odi awerɛhow no nya awerɛkyekye
It might help for the person to promise to contact a confidant should suicidal urges return

Reflecting on such things may very well help a person to keep alive
Ebia nneɛma a ɛtete saa a onii no besusuw ho no bɛboa no ma wakɔ so atra nkwa mu
For though it may seem to some as if the hurt will never go away they can be assured that there are those who have lived through the same kind of pain

According to an old story the sages of India rested in its shade and partook of its fruit
Sɛnea atetesɛm bi kyerɛ no India animdefo gyee mframa wɔ ne nwini ase na wodii n’aduaba no bi
So it has been called the fruit of the wise men

What is it ?	Ɛyɛ aduaba bɛn ?
Why the banana !	Ɛyɛ kwadu !
But how did the banana get from Asia to the Caribbean ?	Nanso ɛyɛɛ dɛn na kwadu fii Asia kɔɔ Caribbean ?
Well early Arab traders carried roots of the banana plant from Asia to the east coast of Africa
Tete Arab aguadifo na wotutuu kwadu mma a wɔde dua no bi fii Asia koduaa no wɔ Afrika apuei fam mpoano
In Portuguese explorers discovered the banana plant growing there and took some roots and its African name banana to Portuguese colonies in the Canary Islands

How Bananas Grow	Sɛnea Kwadu Nyin
The banana plant is not a tree
Kwadu dua nyɛ dutan
It has no wood fibers
Ɛnyɛ den te sɛ dua
Rather it is a gigantic herb that looks like a palm tree
Mmom ɛyɛ afifide kɛse bi a ɛte sɛ adobɛ
Climate and soil determine the growth and size of the plant
Kwadu dua no nyin ne ne kɛseyɛ gyina ewim tebea ne asase ko a wodua wɔ so no so
Bananas grow best in hot damp climates and thrive in rich sandy loam soil that has good drainage
Kwadu nyin yiye wɔ baabi a ɛhɔ yɛ hyew na ɛhɔ yɛ fɔkyee na ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ asase pa a anhwea wom na nsu ntaataa so so
For the best growth the temperature should not go below degrees Fahrenheit C
for any length of time
Sɛ ebetumi anyin yiye a ɛsɛ sɛ baabi a wodua no hɔ hyew boro C
bere biara
To start a crop you have to plant cuttings called suckers cut from the underground stems of mature plants
Sɛ wɔyɛ kwadu fuw a wɔde kwadu nnua nketewa a wɔfrɛ no kwadu mma kwaduase a wotutu fi kwadu dua a anyin ase na edua
Holes are dug a foot
m deep and feet m apart
Wodua kwadu mma no wɔ amoa a emu dɔ bɛyɛ mita

In three to four weeks green shoots appear and tightly rolled green leaves sprout and unroll as they grow
Fi adapɛn abiɛsa kosi anan ntam no nhabammono fifi mu puepue na ahabammono a abobɔ denneennen no mu fi ase baabae bere a ɛrenyin no
Banana plants grow very fast about an inch cm a day
Kwadu dua nyin ntɛmntɛm bɛyɛ sɛntimita da biara
After ten months a plant is full grown and resembles a palm tree standing to feet to m high
Asram du akyi no na kwadu dua a ɛsɛ adobɛ no anyin a ne tenten yɛ fi mita kosi
On a full grown plant a large bud with little purple leaves grows from leaves that wrap into a bundle
Kwadu aniwa kɛse a ɛwɔ nhaban nketewa kɔkɔɔ pue wɔ kwadu dua a anyin awie no nhaban a abobɔ no mu na enyin bɛyɛ kwadu duru
Then clusters of small flowers appear
Afei kwadusiaw nketewaa a nhwiren tuatua so puepue
A plant produces only one bunch which weighs from to pounds to kg and has between and clusters of bananas
Kwadu dua bɔ duru biako pɛ a emu duru yɛ fi kilogram kosi na efi kwadusiaw kosi na ɛwɔ kwaduduru biako so
Each cluster called a hand produces from to bananas
Kwadu mmɛtem kosi na etuatua siaw a wɔfrɛ no nsa no biako so
Thus bananas are called fingers
Enti wɔfrɛ kwadu bɛtem nsateaa
Bananas first grow downward toward the ground then out and up forming the well known banana curve
Kwadu mmɛtem no puepue nea edi kan a enyin kɔ fam na afei ɛkontonkonton
What about nourishment and protection during growth ?	Na ɛdefa ɔkwan a ɛnam so nya ahoɔden ne ahobammɔ bere a ɛrenyin no ho nso ɛ ?
In time a worker comes and removes the bud so that the bananas receive all the energy from the plant
Bere kɔ so no odwumayeni betwa kwadu aniwa no fi kwadu duru no so sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a kwadu no benya ahoɔden a efi kwadu dua no mu ba no nyinaa
Then he covers the fruit with a polyethylene bag to keep out insects
Afei ɔde rɔba bag kata kwadu no ho de bɔ ho ban fi nkoekoemmoa ho
Since bananas grow upward and become very heavy the plant is tied to the base of neighboring plants to prevent winds or the weight of the fruit from toppling it
Esiane sɛ kwadu no nyin wɔ ne dua so na emu yɛ duru bere a enyin nti wɔkyekyere kwadu dua no bɔ nnua foforo a ɛbɛn ho de bɔ ho ban sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a mframa anaa kwadu no mu duru mmu ne dua no
Finally a colored ribbon is tied to the cover to indicate when the fruit will be ready for harvest
Awiei koraa no wɔde ntama bi a wɔahyɛ no aduru bɔ rɔba no ho de kyerɛ bere a wobetwa kwadu no
Every day planes fly over the plantation to spray the leaves of the plants
Wɔde wimhyɛn kyinkyin afuw no so pete kwadu no nhaban no so nnuru da biara da
This protects them from three main diseases
Eyi bɔ ho ban fi nyarewa ho
One is Panama disease in which fungus destroys some plants
Emu biako ne Panama a ɛma kwadu dua no hura na ewu
But these are replaced by types that can resist it
Nanso wodua kwadu bi a etumi ko tia saa yare no de si ananmu
Another is Mako disease caused by bacteria
Kwadu yare foforo ne Mako a mmoawa mmoawa na ɛde ba
It is controlled by removing affected plants and any flowers that attract certain disease spreading insects
Wɔnam kwadu dua biara a yare no bi aka no ne nhwiren biara a ɛtwetwe nkoekoemmoa a wɔma nyarewa hyeta a wotu ase no so na esiw ano
Then there is Sigatoka disease which destroys plant leaves but does not harm the bananas if chemical sprays are used soon enough
Na ɔyare foforo nso ne Sigatoka a ɛsɛe kwadu nhaban no nanso sɛ wɔpete so nnuru ntɛm a entumi nsɛe kwadu no
Bananas need a great amount of water provided by irrigation and by high pressure sprayer systems
Kwadu hia nsu pii na wɔyɛ eyi denam nsu a wotwitwa toto mfuw no mu ne mfiri a ano yɛ den a wɔde petepete so so
It may be added that the plantation is kept free of grass and weeds

From the Plantation to Your Table	Efi Afuw mu Ba Wo Pon So
At the time the color of the ribbon indicates that the bananas are ready for harvest they are first measured to make sure that they are the right size for cutting
Sɛ ntama a ɛbɔ kwadu no ho kyerɛ sɛ bere aso sɛ wotwa a ansa na wobetwa no wodi kan susuw no yiye hwɛ sɛ adu bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wotwa ampa a
Another notable fact is that bananas are never left to ripen on the plant even for local consumption
Ade biako a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛhyɛ no nsow ne sɛ wɔmma kwadu mmere wɔ ne dua so a nea wodi no fie mpo ka ho
Why is this ?	Dɛn ntia ?
Because they would lose their flavor
Efisɛ ɛba saa a ne dɛ so tew
Before deciding when to harvest a crop the distance for exporting and the type of transportation must be considered
Wodi kan susuw kwan tenten a wɔde kwadu no betwa akɔtɔn ne afiri ko a ɛde bɛkɔ ho ansa na wɔatwa
Then a worker cuts off the bunches with his machete and they are sent to the packing plant
Bere a wasusuw ho awie no odwumayeni no de nkrante twa kwadu no fi ne dua so na ɔde kogu ahyehyɛe
And what is done to the banana plant after the harvest ?	Na sɛ wotwa kwadu no wie a dɛn na wɔyɛ dua no ?
It is cut down to fertilize the new plants that will grow in its place
Wotwa to fam ma ɛporɔw yɛ asase no yiye ma foforo a wobedua no
At the packing plant the bananas are washed and any bruised fruit is removed to be eaten by the workers and their families
Wɔhohoro kwadu no ho wɔ ahyehyɛe na woyiyi emu biara a ɛho atiti no ma adwumayɛfo no na wɔne wɔn mmusua adi
Small bananas will be used for flavoring and for baby food
Wɔde kwadu nketewa no fra nnuan mu ma ɛyɛ dɛ na wɔde bi nso yɛ mmofra nnuan
The best bananas are packed pounds kg to a box and sent abroad by refrigerated trains and ships
Wɔde emu akɛse no gugu nnaka mu ma emu duru yɛ kilogram na wɔde gu keteke ne po so ahyɛn a fridge wom mu kɔ amannɔne
On the dock the quality of the fruit is checked and its temperature is taken
Sɛ wodu baabi a wɔde rekɔ hɔ hyɛn gyinabea a wɔhwɛ sɛnea aduaba no di mu fa na wɔhwɛ sɛnea ne hyew anaa ne nwini te
Once cut the fruit must stay green until it reaches the market
Sɛ wotwa fi ne dua so a ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛbere ansa na adu baabi a wɔbɛtɔn no no
Since the banana is perishable it must be picked shipped and sold in the stores within to days
Esiane sɛ kwadu tumi porɔw ntɛm nti ɛsɛ sɛ wotwa de kɔ amannɔne na wɔtɔn no guaso fi nna kosi
The fruit is kept cool at to degrees Fahrenheit C

India s Deadly Quake	Asasewosow a Edi Awu Kɛse wɔ India

 May she took the magazine along to the lecture
May mu no ɔde nsɛmma nhoma no kɔe bere a ɔrekotie ɔkasa no
On the magazine I wrote a note addressed to Mr
LaBudde
Mekyerɛwee asɛm tiawa bi a na mepɛ sɛ Owura LaBudde kenkan wɔ nsɛmma nhoma no so
I said that I thought he would enjoy knowing that this fine article was going to be distributed worldwide in many languages and that the magazine had a printing of over
Mekyerɛwee sɛ misusuw sɛ n’ani begye sɛ obehu sɛ wɔbɛkyekyɛ saa asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye no wɔ wiase nyinaa wɔ kasa ahorow pii mu na wotintim nsɛmma nhoma no biara a ɛba no bɛboro
Then I signed my name and laid the Awake !	Mekyerɛwee me din buee Awake !
open on the podium and returned to my seat
no mu too ɔkasafo pon no so na mesan kɔtraa ase
Shortly I saw a man go over to the podium pick up the magazine and begin reading
Ankyɛ na mihui sɛ ɔbarima bi akogyina ɔkasafo pon no ho a wafa nsɛmma nhoma no afi ase rekenkan
After a few minutes he looked up and asked loudly if the person who left the magazine was present
Simma kakra bi akyi no ɔmaa ne ti so na ɔteɛm bisae sɛ ebia nea ɔde nsɛmma nhoma no bae no wɔ hɔ a
When I raised my hand and said I am he came down and sat next to me
Bere a memaa me nsa so kae sɛ Ɛyɛ me ’ no osiane bɛtraa me nkyɛn
He thanked me for the magazine and said that he appreciates it when someone presents to him information that highlights the work or accomplishments in his field
Ɔdaa me ase wɔ nsɛmma nhoma no ho na ɔkae sɛ sɛ obi ka nea watumi ayɛ wɔ n’adwuma mu ho asɛm a n’ani sɔ
He felt though that I might have made a mistake by saying that the printing was
Nanso na ɔte nka sɛ ebia midii mfomso na mekae sɛ wotintim nsɛmma nhoma no biara a ɛba no no
He thought I must mean
Na ɔte nka sɛ mekyerɛ
I turned to the front of the magazine and showed him that it was
Mebuee nsɛmma nhoma no mu kratafa a edi kan no de kyerɛɛ no sɛ ɛyɛ
He was amazed
Ne ho dwiriwii no
He was also very impressed by the number of languages the magazine was published in now languages
N’ani gyei yiye wɔ kasa dodow a wotintim nsɛmma nhoma no wom no ho mprempren kasa
He thought the magazine was distributed only in the United States but I explained how it is done worldwide

AS TOLD BY MERCY UWASI NIGERIA	SƐNEA MERCY UWASI A OFI NIGERIA KA KYERƐE
THE pain within me started on a sunny West African afternoon in March
ƐYAW a metee wɔ me yam no fii ase March awia bi a na owia no gyina so wɔ Afrika Atɔe Fam
I had gone with my family to our plot of land in order to harvest cassava
Me ne m’abusua kɔɔ yɛn afuw mu sɛ yɛrekotu bankye
While there the pain began to burn in my belly
Bere a yɛkɔɔ hɔ no me yafunu fii ase yɛɛ me yaw
By the time we returned home the pain had become a raging fire
Bere a yeduu fie no na ɛyaw no mu ayɛ den yiye
I was vomiting I had difficulty breathing
Mefee na na mehome a ensi so yiye
Though the pain made it hard for me to stand or walk my mum managed to put me into a taxi which then sped to the nearby general hospital
Ɛwom sɛ na ɛyaw no nti mintumi nnyina hɔ anaa mennantew de nanso me maame bɔɔ mmɔden de me too taksi mu ma wɔde mmirika de me kɔɔ ayaresabea a ɛbɛn hɔ
At the hospital the doctor on call happened to be a man I had once witnessed to about the Bible s hope
Yeduu ayaresabea hɔ no na dɔkta a ɔrehwɛ nkurɔfo no yɛ ɔbarima bi a mede Bible anidaso no adi no adanse pɛn
The doctor touched my belly it was swollen
Dɔkta no soo me yafunu na ahon
He asked if I had been passing blood and my mother said yes that I was having my menstrual period
Obisae sɛ mogya retu me anaa na me maame kae sɛ yiw mayɛ bra
Your daughter is five months pregnant the doctor said
Dɔkta no kae sɛ Wo babea no nyem asram anum
The reason she is bleeding is that she has attempted an abortion
Nea enti a mogya retu no ne sɛ ɔbɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛsɛe yafunu no
Mother countered No Doctor !	Maame buae sɛ Dabi Dɔkta !
She is not that kind of girl
Ɔnte saa
Don t say that
Nka saa
Girls nowadays deceive their parents
Nnansa yi mmeawa daadaa wɔn awofo
She is pregnant
Onyem
Then I spoke up
Afei mekasae
I said that I was one of Jehovah s Witnesses and had been brought up in a Christian household and that my Bible trained conscience would not allow me to take part in an immoral act
Mekae sɛ meyɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako a wɔatete me wɔ Kristofo fie na m’ahonim a wɔde Bible atete no mma me kwan mma memfa me ho nhyɛ ɔbrasɛe mu
In reply the doctor said to my mother Madam let s leave religion aside and be realistic
Ɛno akyi no dɔkta no ka kyerɛɛ me maame sɛ Maame yɛmfa nyamesom nto nkyɛn na yɛnka nokwasɛm
I tell you that this girl is five months pregnant
Meka kyerɛ wo sɛ abeawa yi nyem asram anum
Get up Mother said to me
Maame ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ Sɔre
We re going to another hospital
Yɛrekɔ ayaresabea foforo
As we left the building I sat down on the grass crying because the pain was so bad
Bere a yɛrefi ayaresabea hɔ no metraa sare no so sui efisɛ na ɛyaw no mu yɛ den yiye
Mother rushed me home and told my dad what the doctor had said
Maame yɛɛ ntɛm de me kɔɔ fie na ɔkaa nea dɔkta no aka no kyerɛɛ me papa
They decided to take me to a bigger and more modern hospital a teaching hospital
Wɔyɛɛ wɔn adwene sɛ wɔde me bɛkɔ ayaresabea kɛse bi a wɔwɔ nnɛyi nneɛma a wɔde yɛ yare ho nhwehwɛmu ayaresabea a wɔtete nnuruyɛfo wɔ hɔ
On my way there I prayed to Jehovah to save me so that people would not reproach his holy name by saying I died as a result of an unwanted pregnancy
Bere a yɛrekɔ hɔ no mebɔɔ Yehowa mpae sɛ onnye me nkwa na amma nkurɔfo ansopa ne din kronkron no anka sɛ nyinsɛn a menhwɛ kwan na akum me
I said that if I died when that doctor would see Jehovah s Witnesses coming to preach to him he would say Was it not one of your people that came here pregnant some time ago ? 	Mekae sɛ sɛ miwu na sɛ Yehowa Adansefo kɔ dɔkta no hɔ sɛ wɔrekɔka asɛm akyerɛ no a ɔbɛka sɛ Ɛnyɛ mo nkurɔfo no biako na ɔbaa ha bere bi a na onyem no ? ’
I also prayed that I might be able to go back to that doctor and witness to him once more
Mebɔɔ mpae nso sɛnea menya hokwan asan akɔ dɔkta no hɔ akodi no adanse bio
She Is Still a Virgin ! 	 Ɔda so yɛ Ɔbaabun ! 
At the bigger hospital the same argument that took place in the first hospital reoccurred the doctors thought I was pregnant
Bere a yɛkɔɔ ayaresabea kɛse no akyinnye a yegyee wɔ ayaresabea a edi kan no san sɔree nnuruyɛfo no susuwii sɛ menyem
The pain was terrible
Na ɛyaw no mu yɛ den kɛse
I was crying
Na meresu
A doctor spoke harshly saying That is what you girls always do
Dɔkta bi teɛɛm kae sɛ Saa na mo mmeawa yɛ
You get pregnant then you start shouting
Munyinsɛn na afei moafi ase ateɛteɛm
They did some tests
Wɔyɛɛ nhwehwɛmu ahorow bi
Meanwhile they started throwing some questions at me
Saa bere no ara mu na wofii ase bisabisaa me nsɛm pii
Are you married ? 	 Woaware ? 
 No I said
Mekae sɛ Dabi
How old are you ? 	 Woadi mfe ahe ? 
 Eighteen
Dunwɔtwe
How many lovers do you have ? 	 Wo mpenafo yɛ ahe ? 
 I don t have any lovers
Minni bi
Then the senior doctor began shouting What do you mean ?	Afei dɔkta panyin no fii ase teɛteɛɛm Wokyerɛ dɛn ?
Are you telling me that at years of age you don t have any lovers ? 	Wopɛ sɛ wokyerɛ sɛ obi a wadi mfe no wunni mpena biara ? 
Once again as at the first hospital I explained my Christian stand
Ɛhɔ nso mekyerɛkyerɛɛ me Kristofo gyinabea no mu sɛnea meyɛe wɔ ayaresabea a edi kan no
He then asked if I was one of Jehovah s Witnesses
Afei obisae sɛ meyɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako anaa
I said yes
Mibuae sɛ yiw
After that he didn t ask another question
Ɛno akyi no wammisa me asɛm foforo biara
The tests proved I was not pregnant
Nhwehwɛmu no daa no adi sɛ mennyem
Mother heard one of the doctors say to the others She is still a virgin ! 	Maame tee sɛ dɔktafo no biako ka kyerɛɛ wɔn a aka no sɛ Ɔda so yɛ ɔbaabun ! 
The doctors apologized saying You can t blame us for thinking what we did
Dɔktafo no paa kyɛw kae sɛ Mommma ɛnyɛ mo nwonwa sɛ yenyaa saa adwene no
We experience that kind of thing with girls every day
Yenya osuahu a ɛte saa wɔ mmeawa ho daa
However that ordeal was only the beginning of my trials
Nanso na saa osuahu no yɛ me sɔhwɛ ahorow no mfiase ara kwa
You Will Take Blood 	 Yɛbɛma Wo Mogya ’
An ultrasound test showed a large growth on one of my Fallopian tubes
Nhwehwɛmu bi a wɔyɛe daa no adi sɛ biribi ahon me ntini a mmadwoa fa mu kɔ m’awotwaa mu no biako ho
It was the size of a small grapefruit
Na ne kɛse te sɛ akutu
Surgery was needed
Na ehia sɛ wɔyɛ me oprehyɛn
Unhesitatingly I told them that I would not take a blood transfusion although I would agree to alternative fluids
Meka kyerɛɛ wɔn ntɛm sɛ minnye mogya nanso mɛpene nnuru foforo a wɔde si ananmu so
They insisted that blood was a must
Wɔkɔɔ so kae sɛ mogya ho hia
One of the student doctors chided me saying What you say is what one of your members said some time ago
Dɔkta bi a onwiee sukuu kaa m’anim sɛ Nea woreka yi ara na bere bi mo nkurɔfo no biako kae
But when his condition worsened he accepted a blood transfusion
Nanso bere a ne tebea no mu yɛɛ den no ogyee mogya
My case is different I answered for my yes is yes and my no is no
Mibuae sɛ Me tebea no yɛ soronko efisɛ me yiw yɛ me yiw na me dabi yɛ me dabi
I will never compromise my integrity
Minnyae me mudi mu da
Later three doctors visited my bedside inquiring about my stand against blood
Akyiri yi dɔktafo baasa baa me mpa ho bebisaa me gyinabea a etia mogya no ho asɛm
I explained that the Bible says Christians should abstain
from blood
Acts
Mekyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ Bible no se ɛsɛ sɛ Kristofo twe wɔn ho fi mogya ho
’ Asomafo no Nnwuma
But you are not going to take it through your mouth they pleaded
Wobuae sɛ Nanso yɛmfa mfa w’anom
You will take it through a vein
Yɛde bɛfa wo ntini mu
I said that it didn t matter whether you take it through the mouth or through a vein it is still the same thing
Mekae sɛ ɛmfa ho sɛ wɔde fa w’anom anaa wo ntini mu no ɛyɛ ade koro no ara
On Saturday March a week after the pain had started the head surgeon examined me
Memeneda March a na ɛyɛ dapɛn biako a ɛyaw no fii ase no dɔkta panyin no yɛɛ me yare no mu nhwehwɛmu
He was scheduled to do my operation
Ɔno na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me oprehyɛn no
By then the swelling extended up to my chest
Eduu saa bere no na ade a ahon me no adu me koko so
He asked Have they informed you that you will have to take blood ? 	Obisae sɛ Wɔaka akyerɛ wo sɛ ɛho behia sɛ wugye mogya ? 
 They told me that Doctor but I will not take blood I answered
Mibuae sɛ Dɔkta wɔka kyerɛɛ me nanso minnye mogya
Let me tell you something he continued
Ɔtoaa so sɛ Ma menka biribi nkyerɛ wo
You will take it
Yɛde bɛma wo
If you don t take it you will die
Sɛ woannye a wubewu
On Monday when I come if there is no blood ready for you I will not do the operation
Sɛ meba Dwoda na mogya a yɛde bɛma wo no nni wo nkyɛn a menyɛ oprehyɛn no
No blood no operation
Sɛ woannye mogya a menyɛ oprehyɛn
He then saw a book beside my bed and asked Is this your Bible ? 	Afei ohui sɛ nhoma bi da me nkyɛn na obisae sɛ Eyi yɛ wo Bible anaa ? 
I said no it was my copy of The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived
Mekae sɛ dabi na ɛyɛ Onipa a Ɔsen Biara a Watra Ase Pɛn nhoma no
He said I should use the book to pray that I would not die
Ɔkae sɛ memfa nhoma no mmɔ mpae na manwu
I explained that we don t read our prayers from books
Mekae sɛ yɛnkenkan yɛn mpaebɔ mfi nhoma mu
Whenever we have a problem we pray to Jehovah from our heart
Bere biara a yebehyia asɛnnennen bi no yefi koma mu bɔ Yehowa mpae
During the next two days doctors and nurses kept coming to pressure me into submitting to a blood transfusion
Nnanu a edi hɔ no dɔktafo ne ayarehwɛfo dii me ho akɔneaba bɛhyɛɛ me sɛ minnye mogya
They told me I was too young to die
Wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ misua dodo sɛ mewu
Take blood and live ! they said
Wɔkae sɛ Gye mogya na tra nkwa mu ! 
 Jehovah Is on My Side 	 Yehowa Wɔ M’afa ’
During those times of distress I read Psalm which says in part Out of the distressing circumstances I called upon Jah Jah answered and put me into a roomy place
Wɔ saa ahohia bere no mu no mekenkanee Dwom a ne fa bi ka sɛ Mifi ahohia mu mefrɛɛ Yah na Yah gyee me so nea ɛhɔ trɛw
Jehovah is on my side I shall not fear
What can earthling man do to me ? Psalm
Yehowa wɔ m’afa minsuro dɛn na onipa betumi ayɛ me ? Dwom
After I meditated on these verses my faith in Jehovah was strengthened
Bere a misusuw saa nkyekyem yi ho no ɛhyɛɛ Yehowa mu gyidi a mewɔ no mu den
That morning my parents came to the hospital
M’awofo baa ayaresabea hɔ saa anɔpa no
I showed them that psalm and they felt strengthened in faith too
Mede saa dwom no kyerɛɛ wɔn na ɛhyɛɛ wɔn nso gyidi den
Meanwhile Mother and Daddy not only were supporting my decision not to take blood but were praying for me
Saa bere no ɛnyɛ sɛ na Maame ne Paapa regyina m’akyi wɔ gyinae a masi sɛ minnye mogya no mu nko na mmom na wɔrebɔ mpae ma me nso
Members from my congregation kept on praying and encouraging me from the Scriptures
M’asafo mufo kɔɔ so bɔɔ mpae na wofi Kyerɛwnsɛm no mu hyɛɛ me nkuran
We Are Not Magicians 	 Yɛnyɛ Nkonyaayifo 
On Monday March the morning the operation was scheduled to take place one of the doctors came into my room and saw me holding my Medical Directive card which explains my position on blood transfusion
Dwoda March anɔpa a na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ me oprehyɛn no dɔktafo no biako baa me dan no mu na ohui sɛ mikura me Medical Directive kratasin mogya ho asɛm kratasin no a ɛkyerɛkyerɛ me gyinabea wɔ mogya ho mu no
He said What is this ?	Ɔkae sɛ Dɛn ni ?
Do you really mean what you ve been saying ? 	Enti nea woreka no yɛ w’aniberesɛm ? 
 Yes I am not going to take blood
Yiw minnye mogya
Well he said that means we are going to cancel your operation
Ɔkae sɛ Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ yɛatwa oprehyɛn no mu
No operation
Yɛnyɛ
The doctor then telephoned my mother from my room
Afei dɔkta no frɛɛ me maame wɔ telefon so wɔ me dan no mu
She said She s grown up enough to decide for herself
Me maame kae sɛ Wanyin sɛ n’ankasa tumi si ne gyinae
I cannot decide for her
Mintumi nsi gyinae mma no
She says her Bible trained conscience will not allow her to take blood
Ose n’ahonim a ɔde Bible atete no mma no kwan sɛ onnye mogya
With that he threw my records on the table and stormed out of the room
Ɛno akyi no ɔtoo me yare no ho nkrataa guu pon no so na ofii dan no mu ntɛm
For five hours we heard nothing more
Yɛante obiara nka nnɔnhwerew anum
I was in pain and couldn t eat
Na mete yaw nka na na mintumi nnidi
And there was no other hospital in the area
Na ayaresabea foforo biara nni mpɔtam hɔ
Then to my surprise a stretcher was brought in to carry me into the operating theater
Afei ɛyɛɛ me nwonwa sɛ wɔde ade bae bɛfaa me too so de me kɔɔ oprehyɛn dan no mu
I was clutching my No Blood card
Na me No Blood mogya kratasin no kura me denneennen
On the way to the theater I saw surgical instruments along with packets of blood
Bere a wɔde me rehyɛn oprehyɛn dan no mu no mihuu nneɛma a wɔde yɛ oprehyɛn ne mogya a ɛwɔ nkotoku mu
I started weeping profusely saying that I would not take blood
Mifii ase sui denneennen kae sɛ minnye mogya
One of the nurses said that I should drop the card on the floor
Ayarehwɛfo no biako ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ minnyae kratasin no nto fam
She said I could not carry it into the theater
Ɔkae sɛ mintumi mfa nkɔ oprehyɛn dan no mu
I said I would not enter without the card and that I wanted to show it to the chief surgeon
Meka kyerɛɛ no sɛ sɛ kratasin no nka me ho a menkɔ dan no mu efisɛ mepɛ sɛ mede kɔkyerɛ dɔkta panyin no
The nurse then snatched the card from me and took it into the theater and showed it to the surgeon
Afei ɔyarehwɛfo no hwim kratasin no fii me nsam de kɔɔ oprehyɛn dan no mu de kɔkyerɛɛ dɔkta no
Immediately the head surgeon and five other doctors dressed in their surgical gowns came out to where I was
Ntɛm ara na dɔkta panyin no ne dɔktafo foforo anum a wɔhyehyɛ wɔn ntade akɛse a wɔhyɛ de yɛ oprehyɛn no fii adi baa faako a mewɔ no
The head surgeon was furious
Na dɔkta panyin no bo afuw
He called for my mother pointed to my belly and said to her Look Madam
Ɔfrɛɛ me maame de ne nsa kyerɛɛ me yafunu so kae sɛ Maame hwɛ
We don t know what we will find inside her
Yennim nea yebehu wɔ ne mu
If we have to do a lot of cutting it will lead to severe bleeding
Sɛ ɛho behia sɛ yɛde sekan ka no kɛse a mogya betu kɛse
Do you want her to bleed to death ? 	Wopɛ sɛ mogya tu no ma owu ? 
In reply Mother said to him Doctor I know that Jehovah will be with the girl
Maame buae sɛ Dɔkta minim sɛ Yehowa begyina abeawa no akyi
And he will be with you too
Na obegyina wo nso w’akyi
Just do the best you can and leave the rest to Jehovah
Wo de yɛ nea wubetumi biara na gyaw nkae no ma Yehowa
The doctor then said We are not magicians or herbalists
Dɔkta no kae sɛ Yɛnyɛ nkonyaayifo anaa adunsinfo
We live by what we have learned
Nea yɛasua na yɛde di dwuma
I cannot do this operation without blood
Mintumi nyɛ oprehyɛn yi a mogya nka ho
My mother again implored him to simply do the best he could
Me maame san srɛɛ no sɛ ɔno de ɔnyɛ nea obetumi biara
Finally he agreed to operate without blood
Awiei koraa no ɔpenee so sɛ ɔbɛyɛ oprehyɛn no a ɔmma me mogya
He asked me if I was afraid
Obisaa me sɛ misuro anaa
In reply I said I am not afraid of death
Mibuae sɛ Minsuro owu
I know Jehovah is with me
Minim sɛ Yehowa ka me ho
Continue Serving Your God 	 Kɔ So Som Wo Nyankopɔn No 
The surgery was performed within an hour
Wɔyɛɛ oprehyɛn no wiei wɔ dɔnhwerew biako mu
They opened me up and easily removed the tumor astonishing the hospital staff
Wɔpaee me yam yii ade a ahon me no a wɔammrɛ ho na ɛyɛɛ ayaresabea adwumayɛfo no nwonwa
Afterward one of the doctors told Mother that the student doctors talk about my case at night in their quarters
Ɛno akyi no dɔktafo no biako ka kyerɛɛ me Maame sɛ edu anadwo a dɔktafo a wonwiee sukuu no bɔ m’asɛm no ho nkɔmmɔ wɔ wɔn atrae hɔ
Now when Mother or I go to that hospital they give us special treatment
Mprempren sɛ me ne Maame kɔ saa ayaresabea hɔ a wonni yɛn ho agoru koraa
Two days after my operation the surgeon came into my ward asked how I was then said You should continue serving your God
Wɔyɛɛ me oprehyɛn no akyi nnanu no dɔkta no baa ayaresabea dan a meda mu no mu bebisaa sɛnea me ho te na afei ɔkae sɛ Kɔ so som wo Nyankopɔn no
He really helped you

 ADRIAN always drew more than his share of parental attention his father said
ADRIAN papa kae sɛ Na yɛn ani ku Adrian ho kɛse bere nyinaa sɛ awofo
At age four he drove the family car into a tree making everyone late for the congregation meeting
Bere a odii mfe anan no otuu abusua no kar kɔbɔɔ dua bi mu ma yɛn nyinaa kaa akyi wɔ asafo nhyiam ase
At five he collected dozens of frogs and brought them into the house
Bere a odii mfe anum no ɔkɔsesaw mpɔtorɔ pii baa fie
It took days to get rid of those things
Egyee yɛn nna pii na yɛde tuu saa mmoa no ase
We felt like a family of Egyptians during the Biblical plague of frogs
Yɛtee nka te sɛ nea yɛyɛ Misrifo abusua a mpɔtorɔ pii baa wɔn afie mu wɔ Bible mmere mu no
When he was he found three young raccoons alongside the highway and took them to school in his book bag
Bere a odii mfe no okohuu aboa bi a wɔfrɛ no raccoon abiɛsa wɔ kwankyɛn na ɔde wɔn hyɛɛ ne sukuu bag mu kɔɔ sukuu
When the teacher came in the classroom was in a turmoil children crowded around Adrian s book bag chattering excitedly
Bere a tikya no baa adesua dan no mu no na ɛhɔ ayɛ begyabegya na mmofra atwa Adrian sukuu bag no ho ahyia ma wɔrekasakasa anigye so
The teacher looked in saw the raccoons and drove him and his pets to a facility that took in animal orphans
Tikya no kohuu raccoon no wɔ ne bag no mu na ɔde ɔno ne ne mmoa a n’ani gye wɔn ho no traa kar mu kɔɔ beae bi a wɔhwɛ mmoa mma a wonni awofo
Adrian was in tears at the thought of losing his babies but after touring the facility and seeing baby foxes and other orphans well cared for he left his raccoons there

Just a very busy one

A lively imagination that kept life interesting

Adrian s mother showed another side of him family oriented a homebody a very loving boy
Adrian maame kaa ne suban foforo ho asɛm n’ani gye n’abusua ho n’ani ka fie ɔwɔ ɔdɔ
She relates The children at school described him as a person who would not hurt anyone
Ne maame ka sɛ Sukuu hɔ mmofra no kae sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔnhaw obiara
A girl in his class was limited mentally though not retarded
Na abeawa bi wɔ ne sukuu dan mu a n’adwene ntumi nkyere ade ntɛmntɛm ɛwom sɛ na n’adwene nsɛee de
She rode the school bus with Adrian

Other children made fun of her but her mother told us that Adrian always treated her daughter with respect and a special kindness
Mmofra foforo serew abeawa no nanso ne maame ka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ Adrian kyerɛɛ obu ne ayamye soronko maa ne babea no bere nyinaa

But when he did he surprised us with comments that cut to the heart of matters

She concluded her assessment of her son His sickness made him mature quickly and produced a deeper spirituality in him

He was adamant

He said with tears in his eyes I just could not live with myself if I am given blood

He and his family were Jehovah s Witnesses who reject blood transfusions on the Biblical grounds recorded at Leviticus and Acts

Lawrence Jardine to express himself on the matter of blood
Look Adrian said it wouldn t matter whether my parents were Jehovah s Witnesses or not
Adrian kae sɛ Asɛm no ne sɛ sɛ m’awofo nyɛ Yehowa Adansefo mpo a anka ɛmfa ho
I still wouldn t take blood

Dr

 Yes

His mother also present asked Why are you taking such a stand ? 	Ne maame a na ɔwɔ hɔ bi no bisae sɛ Dɛn nti na woresi gyinae a ɛte saa ? 
Adrian replied Mom it s not a good trade
Adrian buae sɛ Maame mintumi nni nsesa a ɛte saa
To disobey God and extend my life for a few years now and then because of my disobedience to God lose out on a resurrection and living forever in his paradise earth that s just not smart ! Psalm Proverbs

The biopsy was performed on March

It showed that Adrian had a large lymphoma tumor

A subsequent bone marrow biopsy confirmed the fear that he had developed leukemia

Jardine now explained that a very aggressive chemotherapy program with blood transfusions was the only way Adrian could possibly live
Saa bere no Dɔkta Jardine kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ ade biako pɛ a ebetumi ama Adrian anya nkwa ne sɛ wɔde nnuru a ano yɛ den pii ne mogya bɛma no
Adrian however still refused blood transfusions
Nanso Adrian kɔɔ so powee sɛ obegye mogya
Chemotherapy was started without the transfusions
Wofii ase de nnuru a ano yɛ den no dii dwuma a mogya nka ho
Now however with this critical stage of treatment underway there was fear that the Child Welfare Department might intervene and get a court order for custody and the power to give blood transfusions
Nanso bere a wofii saa ayaresa a emu yɛ den yi ase no na ɛda adi sɛ Mmofra Yiyedi Asoɛe no betumi de wɔn ho agye mu afa mmara kwan so agye abofra no afi n’awofo hwɛ ase na wɔanya tumi ama no mogya
The law allowed for anyone years old or over to make his own decision on treatment
Na mmara ma kwan sɛ obiara a wadi mfe anaa nea ɛboro saa ankasa tumi si ayaresa ko a ɔpɛ ho gyinae
The only way for anyone under to have that right was to be classed as a mature minor

That same afternoon at the Supreme Court of Newfoundland convened Justice Robert Wells presiding
During the afternoon session Dr
Bere a ɛbɔɔ awia saa da no Newfoundland Asennibea Kunini no frɛɛ asɛm no na Ɔtemmufo Robert Wells na na ɔyɛ otitrani
Jardine made it very clear to the judge that he considered Adrian a mature minor who had a deep conviction against the use of blood and that he Dr
Jardine had promised Adrian that he would not include blood transfusion in any treatment
Awia no Dɔkta Jardine ka kyerɛɛ ɔtemmufo no pefee sɛ obu Adrian sɛ abofra a n’adwenem abue a ɔwɔ gyidi a emu yɛ den a etia mogya a wɔde bɛma no na ɔno Dɔkta Jardine hyɛɛ Adrian bɔ sɛ ɔmma no mogya wɔ ayaresa biara a ɔde bɛma no mu ɔkwan biara so
Justice Wells asked the doctor that if it came to a court ordered transfusion would he administer it ? Dr
Ɔtemmufo Wells bisaa dɔkta no sɛ sɛ asennibea no hyɛ sɛ wɔmma no mogya a ɔde bɛma no anaa ?
Jardine answered No I personally would not do it
Dɔkta Jardine buae sɛ Dabi me de memfa mma no
He mentioned that Adrian felt that his Biblical hope of eternal life would be threatened
Ɔkae sɛ Adrian te nka sɛ sɛ ɛba saa a ne daa nkwa ho anidaso a egyina Bible so no ho bɛba asɛm
The sincere testimony of this outstanding doctor was both amazing and heartwarming and brought tears of joy to Adrian s parents

When the court reconvened on Monday July David Day presented copies of an affidavit that Adrian too ill to appear in court had prepared and signed stating his own wishes concerning the treatment of his cancer without blood or blood products

 You think a lot about things when you are ill and if you are ill from cancer you know you could die and you think about that

He says he ll give me intense treatment with no blood ever being used

He told me the risks

The way I feel is that if I m given any blood that will be like raping me molesting my body

I don t want any treatment if blood is going to be used even a possibility of it

Throughout the hearing Adrian was confined to his hospital room and Justice Wells very kindly came to see him there with David Day present
Bere a wɔreka asɛm no nyinaa na Adrian aka mpa mu wɔ ayaresabea hɔ na Ɔtemmufo Wells fi ayamye kɛse mu kɔhwɛɛ no bere a na David Day ka ne ho
In giving an account of that interview Mr
Day spoke of Adrian s riveting and compelling remarks to the judge on this one theme in essence I know I m very ill and I know I could die

Some medical people say blood will help
Nnuruyɛfo bi ka sɛ mogya bɛboa
I don t think so with all the dangers I read about it
Misusuw sɛ ɛnte saa esiane nea mekenkan fa asiane a ɛwom nyinaa ho no nti
Whether or not it helps my faith is opposed to blood
Sɛ ɛboa anaasɛ ɛmmoa no ɛne me gyidi nhyia
Respect my faith and you ll respect me
Monkyerɛ obu mma me gyidi mfa nkyerɛ obu mma me
If you don t respect my faith I ll feel violated
Sɛ moankyerɛ obu amma me gyidi a mɛte nka te sɛ nea wɔato me mmonnaa
If you do respect my faith I can face my sickness with dignity
Sɛ mokyerɛ obu ma me gyidi a metumi de nidi agyina me yare no ano
Faith is about all I ve got and now it s the most important thing I need to help me fight the disease
Mr
Gyidi na me biribiara gyina so na mprempren ɛno ne ade a ɛsen biara a ehia sɛ minya na aboa me ma mako atia yare no
Day had some comments of his own about Adrian He was a client capable of handling his critical illness patiently stoically and bravely
Owura Day ankasa kaa Adrian ho asɛm sɛ Ɔyɛ obi a otumi de boasetɔ ahosodi ne akokoduru dii ne yare a emu yɛ den no ho dwuma
There was resolve in his eyes understated confidence in his voice pluck in his manner
Na n’anim kyerɛ sɛ wasi ne bo ne kasa a ano nyɛ den mmoroso no kyerɛ ahotoso a ɔwɔ ne su kyerɛ akokoduru a ɔwɔ
Above all his verbal and body language communicated to me an abiding faith
Nea ɛsen ne nyinaa no ne nne ne ne nipadua a ɔde kasae no ma mihui sɛ ɔwɔ gyidi a efi nokwaredi mu
His signature was faith
Gyidi ne ade a ɛdaa adi kɛse wɔ ne ho
Uncompromising illness required him to build bridges between youthful dreams and adult reality
Ɔyare a emu yɛ den maa ɛho behiae sɛ ogyina ɔhaw ano te sɛ ɔpanyin
Faith assisted him to do so
Gyidi na ɛboaa no ma otumi yɛɛ saa
He was unhesitatingly candid and to my mind truthful
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔka nsɛm penpen na ɛyɛ me sɛ na ɔka nokware
I was alert to the consideration whether his parents had imposed upon him their opposition to blood use in the medical treatment of him
Na minim sɛ ebetumi aba sɛ n’awofo na wɔde pɛ a wɔmpɛ sɛ wɔde mogya ma no wɔ n’ayaresa mu no ahyɛ n’adwene mu
I was satisfied that he exercised a mind of his own in expressing his wish for medical treatment absent blood
Me bo tɔɔ me yam sɛ na n’ankasa wɔ n’adwene a enti ɔmpɛ sɛ wɔma no mogya wɔ n’ayaresa mu no
On another occasion Mr
Day remarked on Adrian s beliefs that were more dear to him than life itself then added This steadfast young man in the face of such problems makes me feel that all the woes of my life are nothing
Bere foforo no Owura Day kaa Adrian nyamesom gyidi no ho asɛm sɛ na ɛsom bo sen nkwa ankasa na ɔde kaa ho sɛ Abarimaa a wagyina pintinn wɔ ɔhaw a ɛtete saa yi nyinaa mu no ma mete nka sɛ m’asetra mu ɔhaw no nyinaa nyɛ hwee

The Decision Adrian a Mature Minor	Gyinaesi No Adrian yɛ Abofra a N’adwenem Abue
On Monday July the hearing concluded and Justice Wells rendered his decision which was later published in the Human Rights Law Journal September
Wobuaa asɛm no Dwoda July na Ɔtemmufo Wells kaa ne gyinaesi na akyiri yi wotintim baa Human Rights Law Journal a ɛbaa September no mu
Excerpts follow 	Emu nsɛm bi na edidi so yi 
 For the following reasons the applications of the Director of Child Welfare are dismissed the child is not in need of protection the use of blood or blood products for the purposes of blood transfusion or injection have not been demonstrated to be essential and in the particular circumstances of this case could be harmful
Esiane nsɛm a edidi so yi nti yentumi mpene asɛm a Mmofra Yiyedi Asoɛe no Panyin de bae no so abofra no nhia ahobammɔ wontumi nnaa no adi sɛ mogya anaa aduru biara a mogya wom a wɔde bɛma no anaa wɔde bɛbɔ no paane no ho hia na nsɛm tebea no kyerɛ sɛ mogya a wɔde bɛma no no betumi ayɛ asiane
Unless a change in circumstances necessitates a further order the use of blood or blood products in his treatment is prohibited and the boy is declared to be a mature minor whose wish to receive medical treatment without blood or blood products is to be respected
Yɛbara mogya anaa aduru a mogya wom a wɔde bɛma no gye sɛ nsɛm tebea no sakra ma ɛho behia sɛ wosi gyinae foforo na yebu abofra no sɛ abofra a n’adwenem abue a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔkyerɛ obu ma ɔpɛ a ɔwɔ sɛ wɔsa no yare a wɔmfa mogya anaa aduru a mogya wom biara mma no
There is no question that this young person is very courageous
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ abarimaa ’ yi wɔ akokoduru yiye
I think he has the support of a loving and caring family and I think he is facing his affliction with a great deal of courage
Misusuw sɛ abusua a wɔwɔ ɔdɔ ne ayamhyehye na wogyina n’akyi na misusuw sɛ akokoduru kɛse na ɔde gyina n’ahohia no ano
Part of his religious belief is that it is wrong for him to use blood products by having them introduced into his body for whatever purposes
Ne nyamesom gyidi no fa bi kyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ wɔde aduru biara a mogya wom bɛma no ma akɔ ne nipadua mu ɛmfa ho atirimpɔw nti a wɔyɛ saa
I have had the advantage of reading an affidavit that was made by A
yesterday and I have had the advantage of hearing his mother who gave evidence and have had the advantage of talking to A
himself
Ɛnnɛra minyaa hokwan kenkan krataa bi a A
Adrian kyerɛwee manya hokwan atie adanse a ne maame bedii na manya hokwan ne A
ankasa akasa
I am satisfied that he believes with all his heart that to take blood would be wrong and that to be forced to take blood in the circumstances about which we are speaking would be an invasion of his body an invasion of his privacy and an invasion of his whole being to the extent that it would impact severely on his strength and ability to cope with the dreadful ordeal that he has to undergo whatever the outcome
Migye tom sɛ ofi koma nyinaa mu gye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mfomso sɛ obegye mogya ma enti hyɛ a wɔbɛhyɛ no ma wagye mogya wɔ tebea a yɛreka ho asɛm no mu no bɛkyerɛ sɛ wɔato ahyɛ no so asɔre atia hokwan a ɔwɔ sɛ ɔyɛ nea ɔpɛ na wɔasɔre atia ne biribiara araa ma ebenya nkɛntɛnso bɔne wɔ n’ahoɔden ne tumi a ɔde begyina ɔhaw a ɛyɛ hu a ɛsɛ sɛ ohyia no ano ɛmfa ho nea ebefi mu aba biara
I agree that the doctor made eminent sense when he said that the patient must be in a cooperative and positive frame of mind about chemotherapy and other cancer treatments in order for there to be any hope any real hope of success and that a patient on whom something is forced contrary to his most deeply held beliefs would be a patient whose suitability for the treatment would be drastically reduced
Mepene so sɛ dɔkta no kaa nyansasɛm kɛse bere a ɔkae sɛ sɛ wobenya anidaso bi a edi mu sɛ ɔyarefo no tebea bɛyɛ yiye a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔpene nnuru a ano yɛ den ne kokoram ayaresa afoforo so na onya ho adwempa na ɔyarefo a wɔhyɛ no ma ɔyɛ biribi a ɛne ne gyidi a emu yɛ den nhyia no yɛ ɔyarefo a ayaresa no mfata no koraa
I think that what has happened to A
has matured him to a degree that would be unthinkable for a year old who is not facing and living with what he is living with and has to face and is facing
Misusuw sɛ nea ato A
no ama n’adwenem abue koraa sen abofra a wadi mfe a onni tebea a ɔrehyia no mu
I think that his experience is as bad an experience I can conceive of and I suspect that their faith is one of the things that is sustaining him and his family
Misusuw sɛ ne suahu no yɛ yaw sen nea metumi asusuw ho biara na minim sɛ ebia gyidi a ɔne n’abusua wɔ no ka nneɛma a ɛwowaw wɔn no ho
I think that what has happened has made A
mature beyond any normal expectation or maturity in a year old
Misusuw sɛ nea asi no ama A
adwene mu abue koraa asen sɛnea yɛbɛhwɛ kwan wɔ obi a wadi mfe ho
I think the boy that I spoke to this morning is very different from a normal year old because of this tragic experience
Migye di sɛ abofra a me ne no kasaa anɔpa yi no nsɛ obi a wadi mfe koraa esiane tebea a ɛyɛ hu yi nti
I think he is mature enough to express a cogent view and he has expressed it to me
Misusuw sɛ n’adwenem abue sɛnea obetumi aka asɛm a emu da hɔ na waka bi akyerɛ me
I am also satisfied that it is proper
for me to take into consideration his wishes and I do so
Afei nso migye di sɛ ɛyɛ papa
sɛ misusuw n’apɛde ho na mereyɛ saa
His wishes are that blood products not be administered and I am satisfied also that if these wishes are countermanded in some fashion by the Director under an order of this Court that his best interests would be manifestly and in a very real sense adversely affected
N’apɛde ne sɛ wɔmmma no aduru biara a mogya wom na migye di nso sɛ sɛ Ɔpanyin no bu n’apɛde yi so wɔ ɔkwan bi so denam Asenni yi ahyɛde bi so a wobehu sɛ aka ne yiyedi na ebepira no ankasa
Furthermore if and this is very possible he should indeed succumb to this disease he would do so in a state of mind that taking into consideration his religious beliefs would be very sad very unfortunate and not at all to be desired
Nea ɛka ho ne sɛ sɛ ɔyare yi kum no ɛnyɛ den koraa sɛ ɛbɛba saa nso na sɛ wɔmaa no mogya a esiane ne nyamesom gyidi nti ɛbɛyɛ awerɛhosɛm na ɛbɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ yaw kɛse a nnipa ani rennye ho koraa
I am taking all these things into consideration
Meresusuw nsɛm yi nyinaa ho
In all of the circumstances I feel that it is proper for me to deny the request that blood products be used in A
s treatment
Wɔ tebea horow no nyinaa mu no mete nka sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mempene so mma wɔmfa aduru biara a mogya wom nni dwuma wɔ A

Adrian s Message to Justice Wells	Krataa a Adrian Kyerɛw Kɔmaa Ɔtemmufo Wells
It was a remarkably thoughtful message that this young boy who knew he was dying sent to Justice Robert Wells which was passed along by Mr

May we anticipate fulfillment for Adrian of Jesus promise at John Do not marvel at this because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out those who did good things to a resurrection of life those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment

 The Life Is in the Blood 	 Nkwa wɔ Mogya no Mu ’
Blood is incredibly complex reaching every cell in the body
Mogya yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse na edu nipadua mu nkwaboaa biara mu
Within a single drop red blood cells carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide white cells seek out and destroy unwanted invaders platelets gather instantly where there is a cut and start clotting to seal off the break

All of these are suspended in clear ivory colored plasma which is itself made up of hundreds of ingredients playing vital roles in the blood s long list of duties

Bloodless Heart Transplant	Koma Foforo a Wɔde ma Obi a Wɔmma no Mogya
Last October three year old Chandra Sharp was admitted to a hospital in Cleveland Ohio U

with a heart that was not only enlarged but also failing

She was undernourished her growth stunted her weight only pounds kg and she needed a heart transplant

She was given only a few weeks to live

Her parents agreed to the transplant but not to blood transfusion
N’awofo penee so sɛ wɔmma no koma foforo nanso wɔmmma no mogya

This was no issue with the surgeon Dr
Charles Fraser
Na eyi nyɛ asɛnnennen mma Dɔkta Charles Fraser
The Flint Journal of Michigan reported on December Fraser said the Cleveland Clinic and other medical centers are becoming adept at performing many surgeries including transplants without the infusion into the patient of other people s blood

We have learned more about how to conserve blood and how to prime the heart lung machine with solutions other than blood said Fraser
Fraser kae sɛ Yɛasua pii afa sɛnea yebetumi asiw mogya a etu obi ano ne sɛnea wodi koma ne ohurututu ho dwuma a wɔmfa mogya nni dwuma no ho

He then added Some specialty hospitals have for decades been doing major cardiovascular operations without blood transfusions

On October he performed the heart transplant on Chandra without blood

Saa na ɛyɛɛ Lenae Martinez a na wadi mfe
Her hope was to live forever on a paradise earth
Na n’anidaso ne sɛ ɔbɛtra ase daa wɔ paradise asase so
This hope was bolstered by the Bible training she had received from her parents who are Jehovah s Witnesses
Bible ntetee a n’awofo a wɔyɛ Yehowa Adansefo de maa no na ɛboaa no ma onyaa saa anidaso yi
Had not she herself read in the Bible that the earth would continue forever that it was created to be inhabited forever and that the meek would inherit it forever ? Ecclesiastes Isaiah Matthew

She had been admitted there for what appeared to be a kidney infection

Tests revealed however that she had leukemia
Nanso nhwehwɛmu ahorow daa no adi sɛ na wanya leukemia mogya nkwammoaa fitaa a ɛdɔɔso mmoroso
The doctors treating Lenae determined that packed red blood cells and platelets should be transfused and chemotherapy started immediately
Dɔktafo a na wɔrehwɛ Lenae no kae sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔma no mogya nkwammoaa kɔkɔɔ ne ntraantraa no bi na wofi ase de nnuru a ano yɛ den ma no ntɛm ara
Lenae said that she wanted no blood or blood products that she had been taught that God forbids that as shown in the Bible books of Leviticus and Acts
Lenae kae sɛ ɔmpɛ mogya anaa aduru biara a mogya wom efisɛ wɔakyerɛ no sɛ Onyankopɔn bara saa adeyɛ no sɛnea Bible nhoma Leviticus ne Asomafo no Nnwuma kyerɛ no
For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication

Her parents supported her in this stand but Lenae stressed that it was her decision and it was very important to her
Lenae awofo gyinaa n’akyi wɔ ne gyinaesi yi mu nanso osii so dua sɛ ɛyɛ n’ankasa ne gyinaesi na ɛho hia no yiye
The doctors talked several times with Lenae and her parents
Dɔktafo no ne Lenae ne n’awofo kasae mpɛn pii
Even so they came again one afternoon
Ɛno akyi mpo no wɔsan baa hɔ awia bi
Lenae said concerning this visit I was feeling very weak from all the pain and had been vomiting a lot of blood
Lenae kaa saa nsrahwɛ yi ho asɛm sɛ Na ɛyaw no ama mayɛ mmerɛw na mafe mogya pii
They asked me the same questions only in a different way

I told them again I don t want any blood or blood products

I would rather accept death if necessary than to break my promise to Jehovah God to do his will

Lenae continued They were back the next morning
Lenae toaa so sɛ Ade kyee anɔpa no wɔsan bae bio
The platelets were dropping and my fever was still high
Na mogya nkwammoaa ntraantraa no so retew na na me ho da so yɛ hyew
I could tell the doctor listened to me more this time
Na mitumi hu sɛ afei de dɔkta no tie m’asɛm yiye
Even though they didn t like my stand they did say I was a very mature year old
Ɛwom sɛ na wɔmpɛ gyinae a masi no de nanso wɔkae sɛ meyɛ abofra a wadi mfe a m’adwenem abue
Later my pediatrician came in and told me he was sorry but nothing would help me but the chemotherapy and transfusions
Akyiri yi dɔkta a ɔhwɛ me no bɛka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɛyɛ ne yaw sɛ ontumi nyɛ biribiara mfa mmoa me gye sɛ ɔde nnuru a ano yɛ den ne mogya ma me
He left and said he would be back later
Ɔkae sɛ ɔrekɔ na ɔbɛsan aba akyiri yi
When he left I started to cry very hard because he had taken care of me all my life and now I felt like he was betraying me
Bere a ofii hɔ no mifii ase sui denneennen efisɛ ɔno na na wahwɛ me fi bere a wɔwoo me ma enti saa bere no metee nka sɛ wayi me ama
When he came in later I told him how he had made me feel that he didn t care about me anymore

This surprised him and he said he was sorry

He did not mean to hurt me
Na ɛnyɛ n’adwene ne sɛ ɔbɛka asɛm ma ahaw me
He looked at me and said Well Lenae if that is the way it has to be then I will see you in heaven
Ɔhwɛɛ me na ɔkae sɛ Lenae sɛ saa na asɛm no te a ɛnde yebehyia wɔ soro

He took his glasses off and with big tears in his eyes said he loved me and gave me a big hug

Then two doctors and a lawyer came told Lenae s parents that they wanted to talk to her alone and asked the parents to leave which they did
Afei dɔktafo baanu ne mmaranimfo bi bae na wɔka kyerɛɛ Lenae awofo sɛ wɔpɛ sɛ wɔne ɔno nkutoo kasa enti wɔmaa n’awofo fii dan no mu
Through all this discussion the doctors had been very considerate and kind and were impressed with Lenae s articulate way of speaking and her deep conviction
Wɔ saa nkɔmmɔbɔ no nyinaa mu no dɔktafo no yii tema ne ayamye kɛse adi na anotew mu a Lenae fi ne wɔn kasae ne ne gyidi a emu yɛ den no maa wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn
When alone with her they told her that she was dying of leukemia and said But blood transfusions will prolong your life
Bere a ɛkaa wɔne Lenae nkutoo no wɔka kyerɛɛ no sɛ leukemia yare rekum no na wɔkae sɛ Sɛ wɔma wo mogya a ɛbɛto wo nkwa so
If you refuse blood you will die in a few days
Sɛ woannye mogya a wubewu wɔ nna kakraa bi mu
If I take blood Lenae asked how long will that prolong my life ? 	Lenae bisae sɛ Sɛ migye mogya a ɛbɛto me nkwa so nna ahe ? 
 About three to six months they answered
Wobuae sɛ Bɛyɛ asram abiɛsa kosi asia
What can I do in six months ? she asked
Obisae sɛ Dɛn na metumi ayɛ wɔ asram asia mu ?
 You will get strong

You can visit Disney World

Lenae thought a bit then answered I have served Jehovah all my life years
Lenae susuw nsɛm ho kakra na obuae sɛ Masom Yehowa me nkwa nna nyinaa mfe ni
He has promised me everlasting life in Paradise if I obey him
Wahyɛ me bɔ sɛ sɛ mitie no a ɔbɛma me daa nkwa wɔ Paradise
I will not turn away from him now for six months of life
Merentwe me ho mfi ne ho seesei na matra ase asram asia
I want to be faithful until I die

Then I know in his due time he will resurrect me from death and give me everlasting life

Then I will have plenty of time for everything I want to do

The doctors and the lawyer were visibly impressed
Ɛdaa adi sɛ dɔktafo no ne mmaranimfo no ho dwiriw wɔn
They commended her and went out and told her parents that she thinks and talks like an adult and is able to make her own decisions
Wɔkamfoo no na wofii adi kɔka kyerɛɛ n’awofo sɛ ne nsusuwii ne ne kasa te sɛ ɔpanyin na n’ankasa tumi si gyinae
They recommended to the ethics committee of the Valley Children s Hospital that Lenae be viewed as a mature minor
Wɔka kyerɛɛ Valley Children’s Hospital hɔ boayikuw a ɛhwɛ abrabɔ ho nsɛm so no sɛ wommu Lenae sɛ abofra a n’adwenem abue
This committee made up of doctors and other health care professionals along with a professor of ethics from Fresno State University made the decision to allow Lenae to make her own decisions with regard to her medical treatment
Boayikuw yi a dɔktafo ayaresabea adwumayɛfo ne mmara ho nimdefo bi a ofi Fresno State Sukuupɔn mu ka ho yi sii gyinae sɛ wɔbɛma Lenae ankasa asi n’ayaresa ho gyinae
They considered Lenae a mature minor

No court order was sought
Wɔamfa asɛm no ankɔ asennibea
After a long difficult night at a
m
September Lenae fell asleep in death in the arms of her mother
Lenae tee yaw nka bere tenten anadwo bi na owui n’adekyee anɔpa wɔ ne maame nsa so wɔ September
The dignity and calmness of that night are etched in the minds of those present
Obiara a na ɔwɔ hɔ no werɛ remfi nidi ne kommyɛ a ɛdaa adi saa anadwo titiriw no da
There were who attended the memorial service including doctors nurses and teachers who had been impressed by Lenae s faith and integrity
Nnipa na wɔkɔɔ ayi no ase a dɔktafo ayarehwɛfo ne akyerɛkyerɛfo a Lenae gyidi ne ne mudi mu kura no yɛɛ wɔn ahodwiriw ka ho
The parents and friends of Lenae were deeply grateful that the doctors and nurses and administrators of the Valley Children s Hospital were so perceptive in discerning the maturity of this minor and that no court case was necessary to make that decision

Crystal Moore	Crystal Moore
Such consideration was not accorded year old Crystal Moore when she was admitted to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City
Wɔansusuw Crystal Moore a na wadi mfe ho wɔ saa kwan no so bere a wogyee no too Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center a ɛwɔ New York City no
She was suffering from inflammatory bowel disease
Na ne nsono kɛse no baabi ahon
Upon her admission to the hospital Crystal along with her parents emphasized repeatedly her refusal to accept blood
Bere a wogyee Crystal too ayaresabea hɔ no ɔne n’awofo sii so dua mpɛn pii sɛ onnye mogya
She did not want to die rather she wanted medical treatment consistent with the Bible s command to abstain from blood
Acts
Na ɔmpɛ sɛ owu nanso na ɔpɛ ayaresa a ɛne Bible ahyɛde a ese yɛntwe yɛn ho mfi mogya ho no hyia
Asomafo no Nnwuma
The medical team caring for Crystal was certain that her condition required a blood transfusion
Na nnuruyɛfo no gye di yiye sɛ Crystal tebea no hwehwɛ sɛ wɔma no mogya
One doctor bluntly stated If Crystal does not have a blood transfusion by Thursday June then on Friday June she will be dead ! 	Dɔkta biako kaa no pen sɛ Ebedu Yawda June na sɛ wɔmmaa Crystal mogya a obewu Fida June !
On June Crystal was not dead and the hospital applied to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for authority to force transfusions
Eduu June no na Crystal nwui na ayaresabea no de asɛm no kɔɔ Asennibea Kunini a ɛwɔ New York no sɛ wɔmma wɔn tumi na wɔmma no mogya
At the hearing which was hurriedly convened at the hospital that morning one of the physicians testified that Crystal needed two units of blood immediately and might need at least an additional ten units
Bere a wɔfrɛɛ asɛm no ntɛm wɔ ayaresabea hɔ anɔpa no nnuruyɛfo no biako dii adanse sɛ Crystal hia mogya nkotoa abien ntɛm ara na anyɛ yiye koraa no ɔbɛsan ahia nkotoa du
He further stated that if Crystal tried to resist the transfusions he would tie her to the bed with wrist and leg restraints to accomplish the procedure
Ɔkɔɔ so kae sɛ sɛ Crystal bɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛpow mogya no a ɔbɛkyekyere no abɔ mpa no mu de nneɛma agu ne nan ne ne nsa na watumi de ama no
Crystal told the doctors that she would scream and holler if they attempted to transfuse her and that as one of Jehovah s Witnesses she viewed any forcible administration of blood to be as repulsive as rape
Crystal ka kyerɛɛ dɔktafo no sɛ sɛ wɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛma no mogya a anka ɔbɛteɛteɛm akekaw mu na sɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako no obu mogya a wɔbɛhyɛ no de ama no biara sɛ akyiwade te sɛ mmonnaato
Despite her attorney s repeated requests at the hearing Crystal was denied the opportunity to speak for herself before the court to demonstrate her decision making ability
Ɛmfa ho sɛ ne mmaranimfo no srɛe wɔ asennii no ase mpɛn pii sɛ wɔmma Crystal kwan mma n’ankasa mmɛkasa wɔ asenni bagua no anim mfa nkyerɛ sɛ n’ankasa tumi si ne gyinae no wɔamma no kwan
Although Crystal had just received an award in the Super Youth Program in recognition of her academic excellence and leadership at her high school the trial judge refused to allow her to testify on record about her refusal of blood
Ɛwom sɛ na ɛnkyɛe na Crystal gyee akyɛde wɔ mmɔden a ɔbɔ wɔ nhomasua ne nneɛma anim a otumi di ho wɔ sukuu mu de nanso ɔtemmufo no amma no kwan amma wammedi adanse wɔ asennibea wɔ nea enti a ɔpowee sɛ obegye mogya no ho
This amounted to a denial of Crystal s rights of due process of law bodily self determination personal privacy and religious freedom
Eyi kyerɛe sɛ wobuu wɔn ani guu hokwan a Crystal wɔ sɛ osi nea ɛbɛba ne nipadua so ho gyinae ne kokoam nsɛm ne ne nyamesom hokwan so
Although the trial court would not allow Crystal to testify on the record the court did visit with Crystal alone in her room for about minutes
Ɛwom sɛ asenni bagua no ampene so amma Crystal ammedi adanse wɔ asennibea hɔ de nanso wɔne Crystal nkutoo kasae wɔ ne dan mu simma
After the visit the trial judge said that Crystal was obviously very intelligent and very articulate and explained that Crystal certainly was sound in mind and capable of expressing herself fully
Wɔ nsrahwɛ no akyi no ɔtemmufo no kae sɛ ɛda adi sɛ Crystal nim nyansa paa na n’ano atew yiye na ɔkaa Crystal ho asɛm sɛ ɛda adi sɛ n’adwene mu da hɔ na otumi kyerɛkyerɛ nsɛm mu fefeefe
Despite these observations the trial court adamantly refused to allow Crystal the opportunity to decide on her own medical care
Ɛmfa ho nsɛm yi nyinaa a ɔkae no asenni bagua no fi mpiyɛ mu powee sɛ wɔbɛma Crystal kwan ma n’ankasa asi n’ayaresa ho gyinae
On Sunday morning June Crystal needed emergency surgery which she consented to but continued to reject blood
Eduu Kwasida June anɔpa no ɛho behiae sɛ wɔyɛ Crystal oprehyɛn ntɛmso na ɔpenee so nanso ɔkɔɔ so pow mogya
Only three ounces cc of blood was lost during the procedure
Mogya kakraa bi na ɔhweree wɔ oprehyɛn no mu
Yet the physicians claimed that a postoperative blood transfusion might be required
Nanso nnuruyɛfo no kyerɛe sɛ ebia ebehia sɛ wɔma no mogya wɔ oprehyɛn no akyi
Another doctor testified that no transfusion was needed
Dɔkta foforo kae sɛ ɛho nhia sɛ wɔma no mogya biara
He had routinely treated similar cases without blood for the past years and no follow up transfusions were ever needed
Na mfe a atwam no wayɛ nnipa pii oprehyɛn a ɛte saa ara a wamma wɔn mogya na owie nso a ɔmma wɔn mogya biara
On June the trial court gave temporary custody of Crystal to the hospital for purposes of blood transfusion to be given only if necessary to protect and save her life
Wɔ June no asennibea no de Crystal hyɛɛ ayaresabea no nsa bere tiaa bi na ɛyɛ a wɔama no mogya bere a ɛho hia na wɔde abɔ ne nkwa ho ban
This guardianship terminated when Crystal was discharged from the hospital
Wɔsan gyee Crystal fii ayaresabea no nsam bere a woyii no fii hɔ no
Crystal never needed blood and none was ever transfused but it is shocking to see how the court treated Crystal
Crystal anhia mogya biara na wɔamma no bi nso da nanso ɔkwan a asennibea no de Crystal faa so no yɛ yaw
Since being discharged from the hospital Crystal graduated from high school with honors
Woyii Crystal fii ayaresabea hɔ akyi no owiee ntoaso sukuu na ɔbɔɔ mmɔden kɛse wɔ ne sɔhwɛ mu
Shortly afterward she became a full time minister as one of Jehovah s Witnesses
Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi no ɔbɛyɛɛ Yehowa Dansefo bere nyinaa somfo
She became a tour guide at the Jersey City Assembly Hall of Jehovah s Witnesses and volunteered as a member of a crew that builds and remodels Kingdom Halls
Ɔbɛyɛɛ obi a odi ahɔho anim ma wɔkɔhwehwɛ Yehowa Adansefo Jersey City Nhyiam Asa so na ofi ne pɛ mu kɔkaa kuw bi a wosiesie Ahenni Asa ahorow na wosi afoforo ho
Yet the doctors at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center said that if she didn t get transfused on June she would be dead on June and that if she resisted the transfusion she would be tied down with wrist and leg restraints
Nanso Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center dɔktafo no kae sɛ sɛ ebedu June na wɔmmaa no mogya a obewu June na sɛ ɔpow mogya no a wɔbɛkyekyere no abɔ mpa no mu de nneɛma agu ne nsa ne ne nan
When doctors wanting court orders to give blood declare blatantly that if the judge doesn t comply immediately the patient will die let them remember the case of Crystal Moore
Sɛ dɔktafo a wɔde asɛm kɔ asennibea sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobetumi ama ɔyarefo bi mogya ka no pen kyerɛ ɔtemmufo bi sɛ sɛ wampene so ntɛm a ɔyarefo no bewu a wɔnkae Crystal Moore asɛm no

Lisa s first night in Toronto s Hospital for Sick Children was worse than a nightmare

She checked in at four in the afternoon and was immediately given a series of tests
Ɔkɔɔ hɔ awia nnɔnnan na wɔyɛɛ ne yare no mu nhwehwɛmu ahorow bi ntɛm ara
She didn t get to her room until a quarter past eleven that evening

Lisa s parents had taken her to Toronto s Hospital for Sick Children hoping to find kind and cooperative doctors
Lisa awofo de no kɔɔ Toronto Mmofra Ayaresabea hɔ a na wɔwɔ anidaso sɛ wobenya dɔktafo ayamyefo a wɔbɛte wɔn ase
Instead their daughter was subjected to the harrowing midnight transfusion in spite of both Lisa and her parents position that blood or blood products are a violation of God s law and are not to be used
Acts

The next morning the hospital sought a court order to give transfusions
Ade kyee anɔpa no ayaresabea no de asɛm no kɔɔ asennibea na wɔanya hokwan ama no mogya
The trial lasted five days presided over by Judge David R
Wɔde nnanum na edii asɛm no na Ɔtemmufo David R

It was held in a room at the hospital Lisa in attendance all five days
Wodii asɛm no wɔ ayaresabea dan bi mu na na Lisa wɔ hɔ nnanum no nyinaa
Lisa had acute myeloid leukemia a condition usually fatal although the doctors testified that the rate of cure was percent

They prescribed multiple blood transfusions and intensive chemotherapy a treatment involving extreme pain and debilitating side effects
Wɔkae sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔma no mogya pii na wɔma no nnuru a ano yɛ den ayaresa a ɛyɛ yaw na ɔhaw a emu yɛ den wɔ akyi
On the fourth day of the trial Lisa gave testimony
Da a ɛto so anan a wɔfrɛɛ asɛm no Lisa dii adanse
One of the questions put to her was how the forced midnight transfusion made her feel
Nsɛm a wobisaa no no biako ne sɛnea ɔtee nka wɔ mogya a wɔhyɛɛ no de maa no no ho
She explained that it made her feel like a dog being used for an experiment that she felt she was being raped and that being a minor made some people think they could do anything to her
Ɔkyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ ɛma ɔtee nka te sɛ ɔkraman a wɔde no resɔ biribi ahwɛ afei nso na ɔte nka sɛ nea wɔreto no mmonnaa na esiane sɛ ɔyɛ abofra nti nnipa bi susuw sɛ wobetumi ayɛ no nea wɔpɛ biara
She hated seeing someone else s blood going into her wondering if she would get AIDS or hepatitis or some other infectious disease from it
N’ani annye ho koraa sɛ ohui sɛ onipa foforo mogya rekɔ ne mu na na osuro sɛ obetumi anya AIDS anaa mmerɛbo mu yare anaa nsanyare foforo bi afi mu
And chiefly she was concerned about what Jehovah would think of her breaking his law against taking someone else s blood into her body
Na nea ehia no sen biara ne sɛnea Yehowa bebu no bere a obu ne mmara a ese onnnye onipa foforo mogya nnkɔ ne nipadua mu so no
She said if it ever happened again she would fight and kick the IV pole down and rip out the IV no matter how much it would hurt and poke holes in the blood
Ɔkae sɛ sɛ ɛba saa bio a anka ɔbɛpere na ɔde ne nan abɔ nea wɔde mogya no sɛn so no ato fam na wayi paane a wɔde mogya fam no ɛmfa ho sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ no yaw afa na watutu mogya nkotoku no mu atokuru

 Well it makes me feel very very angry it makes me feel that they are cruel because my parents have never beaten me they have loved me and I love them and whenever I was sick with strep throats or colds or anything they took care of me

Their whole life was centered around me and now just to have somebody just because they disagree to come and just remove me from them I think is very very mean and it upsets me a lot

Do you want to die ? 	 So wopɛ sɛ wuwu ? 
 No I don t think anybody wants to die but if I do die I m not going to be scared because I know that I have the hope of everlasting life in a paradise on earth

There were few dry eyes as Lisa courageously discussed her impending death her faith in Jehovah and her determination to remain obedient to his law on the sanctity of blood

Lisa her attorney continued would it make any difference to you to know that the court orders you to take transfusions ? 	Ne mmaranimfo no toaa so sɛ Lisa sɛ asennibea no hyɛ sɛ wɔmma wo mogya a wobɛpene so ? 
 No because I m still going to remain faithful to my God and listen to his commands because God is a lot more superior than any court or any man

Lisa what would you like the judge to decide in this case ? 	 Lisa wobɛpɛ sɛ ɔtemmufo no bua asɛm yi dɛn ? 
 Well what I would like the judge to decide in this case is to have me just sent back to my parents and to have them to have custody again with me so I can be happy and so I can go home and be in happy surroundings

She has said and I believe her that she will scream and struggle and that she will pull the injecting device out of her arm and will attempt to destroy the blood in the bag over her bed

Concerning the forced midnight transfusion he said 	Ɛdefa mogya a wɔhyɛɛ no de maa no ɔdasum no ho no ɔkae sɛ

She has wisdom and maturity well beyond her years and I think it would be safe to say that she has all of the positive attributes that any parent would want in a child
Ɔwɔ nyansa ne ahokokwaw a ɛboro ne mfe so na misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ papa sɛ mɛka sɛ ɔwɔ su pa ahorow a ɔwofo biara bɛpɛ sɛ ne ba nya no nyinaa bi
She has a well thought out firm and clear religious belief

In my view no amount of counselling from whatever source or pressure from her parents or anyone else including an order of this court would shake or alter her religious beliefs

She died peacefully at home in the loving arms of her mother and father

In so doing she joined the ranks of many other youthful Witnesses of Jehovah who put God first

As a result she will with them enjoy the fulfillment of Jesus promise He that loses his life for my sake will find it

Ernestine Gregory	Ernestine Gregory
At years of age Ernestine was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia
Bere a na Ernestine adi mfe no nhwehwɛmu daa no adi sɛ wanya leukemia
Upon being hospitalized she refused to consent to the use of blood products to support the chemotherapy the doctors wanted to administer
Bere a wogyee no too ayaresabea no wampene so amma wɔamfa aduru biara a mogya wom anka nnuru a ano yɛ den a dɔktafo no pɛe sɛ wɔde ma no no ho
Because of Ernestine s refusal and her mother s support of her choice of nonblood treatment the hospital reported the matter to the welfare officials in Chicago Illinois U
S
A
who in turn sought a court order to use blood
Esiane sɛ Ernestine powee sɛ obegye mogya na ne maame gyinaa n’akyi wɔ ayaresa a wɔmfa mogya nka ho mu nti ayaresabea no bɔɔ mmofra yiyedi mpanyimfo a wɔwɔ Chicago Illinois U

A hearing was arranged at which the trial court heard testimony from Ernestine a medical doctor a psychiatrist and an attorney as well as from other people involved
Wɔfrɛɛ asɛm no na asenni bagua no tiee Ernestine dɔkta bi adwene ho nimdefo mmaranimfo bi ne nnipa foforo a asɛm no fa wɔn ho no anom asɛm
Ernestine told her doctor she did not want blood
Ernestine ka kyerɛɛ ne dɔkta sɛ ɔmpɛ mogya
That it was her own personal decision based on her reading of the Bible
Ɔka kyerɛɛ no sɛ ɛyɛ n’ankasa ne gyinaesi a egyina nea wakenkan afi Bible mu so
That an involuntary transfusion administered under court order still disrespects God s law and is wrong in her eyes regardless of court authority
Ɔkae sɛ mogya a asenni bagua bɛma wɔahyɛ no de ama no no nso bu Onyankopɔn mmara animtiaa na ɛnteɛ wɔ n’ani so ɛmfa ho sɛ efi asenni bagua hɔ
That she was not opposed to medical treatment and did not want to die
Ɔkae sɛ ɔnsɔre ntia nnuru a wɔde bɛsa no yare na ɔmpɛ sɛ owu
That her decision was not a death wish not suicidal however she did not fear death

Stanley Yachnin M
D
testified that he was impressed with Ernestine s maturity her sense of herself and the sincerity of her religious beliefs
Dɔkta Stanley Yachnin kae sɛ ne ho adwiriw no wɔ sɛnea Ernestine adwenem abue ne gyinae a n’ankasa tumi si ne ne nyamesom gyidi a efi nokwaredi mu no ho
He also said Ernestine understood the nature and consequences of her illness
Ɔkae nso sɛ Ernestine wɔ ne yare no ne nea ebetumi afi mu aba ho ntease
Because of her comprehension Dr
Yachnin saw no need to call in a psychiatrist or a psychologist
Esiane sɛ na abofra no te nsɛm ase nti Dɔkta Yachnin hui sɛ ɛho nhia sɛ wɔma adwenemyare ho nimdefo anaa adwene ne nneyɛe ho nimdefo ba asɛm no mu
Nevertheless one was called Ner Littner M
D
a psychiatrist who after talking with Ernestine was of the opinion that she had the maturity of someone between the ages of and
Nanso wɔfrɛɛ ɔbiako Dɔkta Ner Littner a ɔyɛ adwenemyare ho nimdefo na bere a ɔne Ernestine kasae no ɔkyerɛe sɛ abofra no adwenem abue te sɛ obi a wadi fi mfe kosi
He stated that Ernestine exhibited an understanding of the implications of accepting or refusing blood transfusions
Ɔkae sɛ Ernestine daa no adi sɛ ɔte nea ebefi mogya a obegye anaa ɔbɛpow mu aba no ase
He said she accepted this not because she was under the control of another but because she believed this herself
Ɔkae sɛ ɛnyɛ obi na ɔhyɛɛ abeawa no maa ogye toom na mmom esiane sɛ n’ankasa gye di nti
Dr
Littner said Ernestine should be allowed to make her own decision in this matter
Dɔkta Littner kae sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔma Ernestine ankasa si ne gyinae wɔ asɛm yi ho
Jane McAtee an attorney for the hospital testified that after interviewing Ernestine she believed that Ernestine understood the nature of her illness and that she seemed fully capable of understanding her decision and accepting the consequences of it
Jane McAtee ayaresabea no mmaranimfo kae sɛ bere a obisabisaa Ernestine nsɛm no obehui sɛ Ernestine nim sɛnea yare no te na ɛda adi sɛ na ɔte ne gyinaesi no ase koraa na ogye nea ebefi mu aba no tom
The court too was very impressed with Ernestine s testimony
Asenni bagua no nso ho dwiriw wɔn yiye wɔ Ernestine anom asɛm no ho
The court found that Ernestine was a mature year old able to make informed medical decisions yet amazingly the court granted an order allowing blood transfusions
Asenni bagua no hui sɛ Ernestine yɛ obi a wadi mfe a n’adwenem abue na n’ankasa na osii saa gyinae no na na ɔte tebea a ɔwom a egye ntɛmpɛ no ase
At the hospital two doctors were standing by transfusion equipment set up and as soon as the court s decision came in the transfusion was forcibly given to Ernestine in spite of her vigorous protests
The court s order was promptly appealed but not in time to stop the hospital s precipitate transfusion
Nanso ɛmfa ho sɛ ɔdaa no adi sɛ ɔyɛ abeawa a n’adwenem abue a otumi fi nea onim mu si ayaresa ho gyinae a nyansa wom a ɛne ne gyinapɛn ne ne gyidi a emu yɛ den no hyia ma ne ho no ɛyɛɛ nwonwa sɛ asenni bagua no maa kwan sɛ wɔmma no mogya
To stop any further transfusions the trial court s order was first appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court
Wɔde asɛm no kɔdan asennibea a wɔde asɛm dan a ɛwɔ Illinois no
In a two to one decision the Appellate Court held that Ernestine could not be forced to submit to blood transfusions against her will
Asennibea a wɔde asɛm kɔdan wɔn no buae sɛ wontumi nhyɛ Ernestine mma onnye mogya na abaguafo baanu penee so tiaa obiako
The court reasoned that Ernestine s First Amendment right of religious free exercise along with her constitutional right of privacy protected her right as a mature minor to refuse blood transfusions for religious reasons
Asennibea no kyerɛe sɛ sɛ abofra a n’adwenem abue no mmara a ɛfa hokwan a Ernestine wɔ sɛ odi ne nyamesom ho dwuma ne hokwan a ɔwɔ sɛ osi n’ankasa gyinae ho no ma no kwan sɛ otumi pow mogya esiane nyamesom mu ntease nti
The child welfare officials then appealed the Appellate Court s decision to the Illinois Supreme Court
Afei mmofra yiyedi mpanyimfo no de gyinaesi yi kɔdan Illinois Asennibea Kunini no
The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed ruling that even though Ernestine was a minor she had the right to refuse medical treatment that was objectionable to her
Illinois Asennibea Kunini no gyinaa saa gyinaesi no akyi na wɔkae sɛ ɛwom sɛ Ernestine yɛ abofra de nanso ɔwɔ hokwan sɛ ɔpow ayaresa a ɔmpene so
This supreme court based its decision on the common law right of bodily self determination and the mature minor rule
Asennibea kunini yi de wɔn gyinaesi no gyinaa mmara a ɛkyerɛ sɛ obi wɔ hokwan sɛ osi gyinae fa n’ankasa nipadua ho ne mmara a ɛfa mmofra a wɔn adwenem abue ho no so
The standard to be applied in mature minor cases in Illinois was summarized by the Illinois Supreme Court in the following statement 	Illinois Asennibea Kunini no bɔɔ gyinapɛn a wɔde bedi dwuma wɔ nsɛm a ɛfa mmofra a wɔn adwenem abue ho no mua sɛnea edi so yi 
 If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment
Sɛ adanse no ma ɛda adi na ntease wom sɛ abofra no adwenem abue sɛ otumi hu nea ebefi ne nneyɛe mu aba na obetumi de atɛmpa adi dwuma te sɛ ɔpanyin a ɛnde mmofra a wɔn adwenem abue ho mmara no ma no kwan sɛ ɔpene anaa ɔpow ayaresa no
Ernestine had no further transfusions and she did not die from her leukemia
Wɔamfa nnuru a ano yɛ den anaa mogya biara amma Ernestine nanso leukemia no ankum no sɛnea na dɔktafo no pɛ sɛ asennibea no gye di no
Ernestine stood firm and put God first like the other young people mentioned previously
Ernestine gyinaa pintinn de Onyankopɔn dii kan te sɛ mmofra a yɛadi kan aka wɔn ho asɛm no
Each one received power beyond what is normal

Alligators Rare White and Blue Eyed !	Adɛnkyɛm Wɔn Ho Yɛ Na Wɔn Ho Yɛ Fitaa na Wɔn Aniwa Yɛ Bruu !
THE following release prepared by Curt Burnette for Audubon Institute tells the story of the remarkable white alligators
NSƐM a edidi so a Curt Burnette kyerɛw maa Audubon Institute yi fa adɛnkyɛm fitaa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa no ho
The white skinned blue eyed alligators are a genetic mutation of the American alligator and not a different species
Adɛnkyɛm fitaa a wɔn aniwa yɛ bruu no yɛ Amerika adɛnkyɛm no bi a nsakrae aba wɔn awosu mu na mmom ɛnyɛ adɛnkyɛm foforo
This mutation is called leucism therefore these are leucistic alligators
Wɔfrɛ saa awosu mu nsakrae yi leucism biribi a ɛhoa enti wɔyɛ adɛnkyɛm a wɔn ho hoa
Albinos have white skin and pinkish yellow eyes
Mmoa a wɔn ho te sɛ ofiri aniwa yɛ kɔkɔɔ kakra
Leucistic animals have pigmented eyes
Mmoa a wɔn ho hoa aniwa dum
Albinism is rare but leucism is even more rare
Mmoa a wɔn ho te sɛ ofiri ho yɛ na nanso wɔn a wɔn ho hoa no ho yɛ na sen saa
Although leucism is known in a few other species of animals the white gators are the first known leucistic alligators

There are white gators all discovered at the same nest site in late August

Three Cajun fishermen found them near Houma Louisiana southwest of New Orleans

The nest was located on land owned by the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company LL E

Although the nest area has been watched and eggs collected and hatched out no further white gators have ever been discovered
Ɛwom sɛ wɔawɛn faako a na ebuw no wɔ no asesaw nkesua ma apae de nanso wonhuu adɛnkyɛm fitaa foforo biara
All white gators and their normal siblings are male
Adɛnkyɛm fitaa no ne a wɔn ho nhoa no nyinaa yɛ anini
This is possible because the sex of a baby alligator is determined by the temperature of the nest and so can be all male all female or a mix

How come there are so few white gators and no one had ever seen any before ?	 Dɛn nti na adɛnkyɛm fitaa ho yɛ na saa na ɛde besi saa bere no na obiara nhuu bi da ?
Besides being rare mutations to begin with leucistic and albinistic alligators are at a distinct and deadly disadvantage from normal alligators

When a baby gator hatches it s only inches long

The mother gator guards the nest for a while but soon the little gators are on their own

A white hatchling would easily be spotted by and fall prey to many different predators

Two last interesting and unusual facts about the white gators their black spots and their temperament
Nokwasɛm abien a etwa to a ɛyɛ anika na ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ adɛnkyɛm fitaa ho ni wɔn ho a asisi tuntum ne wɔn suban
Only a very few of the white gators were hatched with black spots
Adɛnkyɛm fitaa no kakraa bi na bere a wɔpaee wɔn no na wɔn ho asisi tuntum
Most had none at all
Na wɔn mu dodow no ara ho nsisii koraa
As they grew however more began developing some black areas
Nanso bere a wɔrenyin no wɔn mu pii ho fii ase sisii tuntum
Almost all the spots developed around the head and neck only
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔn ti ne wɔn kɔn ho nkutoo na esisii
It has made it easier to identify who is who although some have never acquired any spots at all
Ama ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wubehu wɔn mu nsonsonoe ɛwom sɛ wɔn mu bi ho nsisii koraa de
And finally it is agreed by everyone who has worked with the white gators they are more feisty and temperamental than normal alligators

What If I Fall For an Unbeliever ?	Sɛ Minya Ɔdɔ ma Obi a Onnye Nni Ɛ ?
 I have a problem confessed one Christian girl
Kristoni abeawa bi gye toom sɛ Biribi haw me
I have a crush on my neighbor
Manya me fipamfo bi a onnye nni ho anigye a ɛmfata
He is kind polite and considerate but there is one thing he is not a lover of Jehovah
Ne yam ye obu ade na ɔyɛ timmɔbɔ nanso aka no ade biako ɔnnɔ Yehowa
I know it is wrong for me to like him but I am not sure how to handle my feelings for him
Minim sɛ enye sɛ mɛpɛ no nanso minhu nea mɛyɛ a medi ɔdɔ a manya ama no no so
Mark was years old when he found himself in a similar situation
Na Mark adi mfe na ohui sɛ ɔwɔ tebea a ɛte saa ara mu
He became infatuated with a girl who did not share his religious beliefs
Obenyaa abeawa bi a ɔne no nni ɔsom biako mu ho akɔnnɔ
I would often daydream about what it would be like together married he says
Ɔka sɛ Na metaa nya nsusuwii hunu wɔ tra a me ne no bɛtra sɛ awarefo no ho
But I knew it was wrong
Nanso na minim sɛ ɛnteɛ
CRUSHES and infatuations are common during the teenage years when romantic impulses run strong
MMOFRA a wɔadu mpanyin mfe so a nna ho nkate a ɛwɔ wɔn mu yɛ den no na wɔtaa nya akɔnnɔ a ɛmfata
Compare Corinthians
Fa toto Korintofo ho
Having no safe outlet for such feelings youths are prone to develop infatuations for favorite teachers entertainers and the like
Bere a mmofra nni ɔkwampa biara a wɔbɛfa so adi nkate a ɛte saa ho dwuma no wɔtaa nya wɔn akyerɛkyerɛfo ne guasodeyɛfo a wɔn ani gye wɔn ho ne afoforo ho akɔnnɔ a ɛmfata
Since personal relationships with such adults are for the most part unattainable these crushes are usually short lived and relatively harmless
Esiane sɛ mpɛn pii no wonnya hokwan biara a wɔne mpanyimfo a wɔtete saa betumi anya nkitahodi biara nti ɔdɔ a ɛte saa a wonya no ntaa nkyɛ na ɛmfa ɔhaw mma kɛse
What though if you have developed strong feelings for a peer someone willing and able to have a relationship but that person simply does not share your religious beliefs ?	 Nanso sɛ woanya akɔnnɔ a emu yɛ den ama wo tipɛn bi obi a ɔwɔ ɔpɛ na obetumi ne wo abɔ nanso onii no ne wo nni ɔsom biako mu nso ɛ ?
Some might not see this as a problem
Ebinom remmu eyi sɛ asɛnnennen bi
For one thing many youths have little interest in religion
Ade biako ne sɛ mmofra pii ani nnye nyamesom ho
And even among those who do dating someone of a different faith may not always be frowned upon
Na wɔn a wɔn ani gye ho mpo fam no ebia ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na wɔrempɛ sɛ wɔne obi a ɛsono ne gyidi bɛyɛ nhyehyɛe afi adi
Liberal minded people might even approve of it
Nnipa a wɔma biribiara hokwan bɛkyerɛ ho anigye mpo
Many adults though see the potential problems in such relationships especially since they often result in marriage
Nanso mpanyimfo pii nim nsɛnnennen a ayɔnkofa a ɛte saa betumi de aba titiriw esiane sɛ ɛtaa kowie aware mu nti
Writer Andrea Eagan thus advised youths Having the same religious background isn t important if neither of you is religious
Enti nhoma kyerɛwfo Andrea Eagan tuu mmofra fo sɛ Sɛ mo mu biara ani nnye nyamesom ho a ɛnde ɔsom biako a wɔtetee mo wom no nka hwee
But if religious practice is important to one or both of you then differences about religion do have to be taken into consideration
Nanso sɛ ɔsom ho hia mo mu biako anaa mo baanu nyinaa a ɛnde na ɛsɛ sɛ mususuw ɔsom mu nsonsonoe no ho
You don t have to be the same when it comes to religion
but you do have to be able to live with each other
Enhia sɛ mo baanu bɛwɔ ɔsom biako mu
nanso ɛsɛ sɛ mutumi bom tra na mofata mo ho
Such advice may sound reasonable
Ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ntease wɔ afotu a ɛte saa mu
But in reality it reflects the wisdom of this world
Nanso nokwarem no wi yi ase nyansa na ɛda no adi
The Bible shows that a romance between a believer and an unbeliever raises issues of far greater importance than marital compatibility
Bible da no adi sɛ gyidini ne nea onnye nni ntam ayɔnkofa a ɛte saa ma nsɛm a ɛho hia koraa sen fata a wɔmfata wɔn ho wɔ aware mu sɔre
Youths among Jehovah s Witnesses know this is a matter of obedience to God s Word which urges Christians to marry only in the Lord
Yehowa Adansefo mmofra nim sɛ eyi fa osetie a wɔyɛ ma Onyankopɔn Asɛm ho nea ɛhyɛ Kristofo sɛ Awurade mu nko na wɔnware no
Since dating is not mere recreation but a prelude to marriage it would displease God for one of his servants to get romantically involved with someone who has not dedicated his or her life to Jehovah
Esiane sɛ nhyehyɛe a ɔbarima ne ɔbea yɛ de fi adi nyɛ anigyede ara kwa na ekowie aware mu nti ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛnsɔ Onyankopɔn ani sɛ ne somfo bi ne obi a onhyiraa ne nkwa so mmaa Yehowa benya ayɔnkofa a ɛte saa
Even so some Witness youths have found themselves becoming attracted to unbelievers
Ne saa mpo no Adansefo mmofra binom hu sɛ wɔn ani agye wɔn a wonnye nni ho
How does this happen ?	Ɛyɛ dɛn na eyi ba ?
What should you do if you find yourself in such a situation ?	Sɛ wuhu sɛ wowɔ saa tebea yi mu a dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ?
How It Happens	Ɔkwan a Ɛnam so Ba
Realize first of all that all humans are prone to error
Nea edi kan koraa no hu sɛ nnipa nyinaa tumi di mfomso
Mistakes who can discern ? asked the psalmist
Odwontofo no bisae sɛ Hena na ohu mfomso mu ? ’
Youths are particularly subject to errors in the realm of romance
Mmofra titiriw na wɔtaa di mfomso wɔ ɔdɔ ho
Why ?	Dɛn ntia ?
For the simple reason that they lack the shrewdness that comes with experience and age
Nea enti a ɛte saa ne sɛ wonni nyansa a osuahu ne onyin de ba no
Having had little experience in dealing with the opposite sex a Christian youth may simply not know how to handle romantic attraction or attention
Esiane sɛ osuahu ketewaa bi na Kristoni abofra wɔ wɔ sɛnea ɔne obi a ɛsono ne bɔbeasu di nsɛm mu nti ebia ɔrenhu sɛnea obedi obi ho anigye a onya anaa ne ho anigye a obi nya no ho dwuma ɔkwampa so
This was the case with Sheila when she realized that a schoolmate had a crush on her
Saa na na ɛte wɔ Sheila fam bere a ohui sɛ ne yɔnko sukuuni bi anya ne ho anigye no
I could tell that he liked me said Sheila
Sheila kae sɛ Na mitumi hu sɛ ɔpɛ me
During lunch hours he would come over and eat with me
Sɛ yekodidi awia bere a na ɔne me bedidi
During study periods in the library he would seek me out
Sɛ yekosua ade wɔ nhomakorabea a na ɔhwehwɛ me
Sheila s feelings for the boy began to grow
Sheila fii ase nyaa abarimaa no ho anigye kɛse
Mark mentioned earlier similarly recalls I would always see this girl in gym class
Saa ara na Mark a yɛadi kan aka ne ho asɛm no ka sɛ Na mihu abeawa yi wɔ sukuu dan a yɛteɛteɛ yɛn apɔw mu wɔ hɔ no mu bere nyinaa
She would go out of her way to come up and talk to me
Na ɔbɔ mmɔden biara ba me nkyɛn ne me bɛkasa
It was not hard for a friendship to develop
Anyɛ den sɛ yɛbɛfa adamfo
In the case of year old Pam a neighborhood boy went so far as to give her a ring as an expression of his affection for her
Ɛdefa Pam a wadi mfe ho no abarimaa bi a ɔte ne mpɔtam yɛɛ ade kɔɔ akyiri koduu sɛ ɔmaa no kawa de kyerɛe sɛ ɔdɔ no
Admittedly it has not always been a case of a Witness being the innocent victim of advances
Ampa ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na wɔn a wɔnyɛ Adansefo no na wɔyɛ biribi de kyerɛ sɛ wɔpɛ Adansefo no
One girl was merely reciprocating the obvious interest shown by a Christian boy named Jim
Na abeawa bi reyɛ biribi de akyerɛ sɛ ɔpene anigye a Kristoni abarimaa bi a wɔfrɛ no Jim ada no adi pefee akyerɛ no no so
The pressure was on though when one day she showed up at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah s Witnesses looking for him !	Nanso da bi a abeawa no baa Yehowa Adansefo Ahenni Asa so bɛhwehwɛɛ no no ɛkaa abarimaa no ma ohuu mfomso a wadi !
Whatever the circumstances you may have known it was wrong to get involved
Sɛnea tebea no te biara no ebetumi aba sɛ na wunim sɛ wo ho a wode bɛhyɛ adeyɛ a ɛte saa mu no nteɛ
But sometimes it is hard to resist attention from the opposite sex

Afe a ɔkɔɔ ntoaso sukuu no na n’awofo regyae aware
I needed someone to talk to he recalls
Ɔka sɛ Na mihia obi a me ne no bɛbɔ nkɔmmɔ
A girl in school seemed always to have the right word of encouragement for him
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na abeawa bi wɔ sukuu hɔ a ɔka nkuranhyɛ nsɛm a ɛfata kyerɛ no bere nyinaa
Mutual romantic feelings soon developed

Proverbs says Can a man rake together fire into his bosom and yet his very garments not be burned ? 	Mmebusɛm ka sɛ So onipa de ogya bɛhyɛ ne kokom na ne ntade renhyew ? 
Consider for example the experience of a girl named Kim
Sɛ nhwɛso no susuw abeawa bi a wɔfrɛ no Kim suahu ho
Although raised as a Christian she allowed herself to get emotionally involved with a boy at school
Ɛwom sɛ wɔtetee no sɛ Kristoni de nanso ɔne abarimaa bi nyaa ayɔnkofa a emu yɛ den wɔ sukuu mu
He was one of the most popular and exciting guys in school Kim recalls
Kim ka sɛ Na ɔyɛ mmarimaa a wɔagye din na wɔn ho yɛ anika wɔ sukuu hɔ kɛse no mu biako
Before long she was secretly attending parties where drugs were used openly
Ankyɛ na Kim fii ase wiaa ne ho kɔɔ apontow ahorow a wɔde nnubɔne dii dwuma pefee ase
I was so scared but I was in love with him

Kim married her boyfriend but he ended up in prison for armed robbery

Once again the Bible s warning had proved true Bad associations spoil useful habits
Corinthians
Bible kɔkɔbɔ no baa mu wɔ ha nso Fekubɔne sɛe ɔbra pa
Korintofo
This is not to imply that all youths who are not Jehovah s Witnesses are immoral or use drugs
Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ mmofra a wɔnyɛ Yehowa Adansefo nyinaa na wɔbɔ ahohwibra anaa wɔnom nnubɔne
At the very least however such youths do not share the same values viewpoints or goals as Witness youths
Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no mmofra a wɔte saa no ne Adansefo mmofra adwene wɔ nneɛma a ɛsom bo nsusuwii anaa wɔn botae horow ho nyɛ biako
First Corinthians explains that an unbeliever simply does not receive the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness to him and he cannot get to know them because they are examined spiritually
Korintofo nhoma a edi kan ti kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ obi a onnye nni nnye Onyankopɔn honhom ade na ɛyɛ no nkwaseasɛm na ontumi nhu mu efisɛ wobu mu atɛn honhom mu
Think of how much your religious values have shaped your emotions the joy you experience at Christian meetings the thrill of sharing the Bible s message with a receptive person the pleasure of studying the Bible itself
Susuw sɛnea nyamesom gyinapɛn ahorow anya wo nkate so tumi anigye a wunya wɔ Kristofo nhyiam horow ase ahurusi a wudi wɔ Bible mu nsɛm a woka kyerɛ obi a otie ho ne Bible sua ankasa mu anigye
Can an unbeliever possibly grasp much less share such feelings ?	So obi a onnye nni betumi ate eyinom ase na kampɛsɛ wanya mu anigye ?
Hardly

Paul thus exhorts Christians Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers
For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have ?	Enti Paulo tu Kristofo fo sɛ Mo ne wɔn a wonnye nni nntwe kɔndua koro na twaka bɛn na trenee ne amumɔyɛ wɔ ?
Or what sharing does light have with darkness ?	Anaasɛ ayɔnkofa bɛn na hann ne sum wɔ ?
Further what harmony is there between Christ and Belial ?	Na ɔka bɛn na Kristo ne Belial ka ?
Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever ? 	Anaasɛ kyɛfa bɛn na ogyidini ne nea onnye nni wɔ ? 
Young Sonya learned this lesson firsthand when she became emotionally involved with an unbeliever
Abeawa Sonya nyaa eyi mu osuahu bere a ɔne obi a onnye nni benyaa ayɔnkofa a emu yɛ den
She admits Having a companion who doesn t share your zeal and love for Jehovah is the worst loneliness imaginable
Ogye tom sɛ Sɛ wubenya ɔhokafo a ɔne wo nnya kyɛfa wɔ wo mmɔdenbɔ ne ɔdɔ a wowɔ ma Yehowa mu no yɛ ade a ɛma obi te ankonamyɛ nka sen biara
It is emotionally crushing
Ɛde nkate mu yaw kɛse ba
When the truth is the motivating force of your life you have to share it you just have to !	Sɛ nokware no ne ade a edi w’asetra so a wo ho pere wo sɛ wo ne obi benya mu kyɛfa ɛyɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ !
It s such a very empty feeling when you can t share it with your mate because you re with an unbeliever
Bere a wuntumi ne wo hokafo nnya mu kyɛfa esiane sɛ ɔnyɛ gyidini nti no ɛma wote abasamtu nka
In such a relationship then religion is likely to become not a common ground but a focal point of contention
Wɔ abusuabɔ a ɛte saa mu no nyamesom remmɛyɛ ade a ɛka mo bom na mmom ade titiriw a ɛde akasakasa ba
You could easily feel forced to downplay your spiritual interests in order to keep peace
Ebetumi ahyɛ wo ma woatoto wo honhom mu nneɛma ase sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a asomdwoe bɛba mo ntam
But doing so would only devastate your spirituality
Nanso saa a wobɛyɛ no bɛsɛe wo honhom mu yiyedi
One young woman relates I became quite close with a guy who was not a Witness
Abeawa bi ka sɛ Me ne abarimaa bi a ɔnyɛ Ɔdansefo bɛfaa adamfo papee
But as the friendship grew closer I realized I had fallen in love with him
Nanso bere a adamfofa no mu yɛɛ den kɛse no mibehui sɛ manya ɔdɔ ama no
Little by little my relationship with Jehovah kept having less importance for me my relationship with this boy became the most important thing to me
Nkakrankakra me ne Yehowa ntam abusuabɔ bɛyɛɛ biribi a ɛho nhia me titiriw biara me ne abarimaa yi ntam abusuabɔ bɛyɛɛ ade titiriw maa me
I no longer wanted to go to meetings associate with my Christian brothers or go out in the preaching work
Na mempɛ sɛ mekɔ nhyiam horow ne me nuanom Kristofo konya fekubɔ anaa mekɔ asɛnka bio
All I wanted to do was to be with him
Nea na mepɛ ara ne sɛ me ne abarimaa no bɛbɔ bere nyinaa
I became inactive as a Witness for the next two years
Mebɛyɛɛ Ɔdansefo a wayɛ mmerɛw mfe abien a edi hɔ no
And throughout it all my friend never reciprocated my love for him
Na ne nyinaa mu no m’adamfo ’ no ankyerɛ ɔdɔ a mewɔ ma no no ho anigye da
I kept thinking that someday he eventually would but it never happened
Mekɔɔ so susuwii sɛ ebia bere kɔ so no ɔbɛkyerɛ me ho anigye da bi nanso amma saa da
Yes getting involved with someone who doesn t share your religious and moral values is sure to bring you sorrow and unhappiness
Yiw obi a onni nyamesom ne abrabɔ gyinapɛn ahorow a wowɔ no bi a wo ne no bɛbɔ no de awerɛhow ne yawdi bɛba wo so ɔkwan biara so
The course of wisdom is to withdraw from such an uneven yoking

Ɛnde ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ aseresɛm abu so wɔ abɔde mu nnyinamoa ne akraman mma a wobu afuni a ntease nnim gyata ba a ɔwe ne na dua ho kosi sɛ ne na bɛbɔ no asoroboa mma a wɔpam wɔn ho hwehwe wɔn ho so wɔ nnua so
There is humor all around us waiting to be observed and appreciated
Aseresɛm atwa yɛn ho ahyia a yebetumi ahwɛ aserew
This is not to say that all people laugh at the same things
Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ nnipa nyinaa serew wɔ ade koro ho
On the contrary what is funny often depends on one s culture personality background and mood as well as other factors
Nea ɛne eyi bɔ abira no sɛ biribi bɛyɛ obi serew a ɛtaa gyina n’amammerɛ nipasu ntetee nkate ne nneɛma foforo so
Virtually everyone though will respond with laughter to something a funny story a pleasant surprise a joke a clever play on words
Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara serew wɔ biribi ho asɛm bi a ɛyɛ anika akyɛde bi a wɔnhwɛ kwan asɛnkwaa bi ne nsɛmfua bi a wɔka ma ɛyɛ anigye
What purpose does humor serve ?	Mfaso bɛn na ɛwɔ serew so ?
At the very least it is a means of better relating to others
Anyɛ yiye koraa no ɛyɛ ade a ɛma yɛne afoforo nya abusuabɔ pa
One comment called laughter the shortest distance between two people
Obi frɛɛ ɔserew sɛ ɔkwantiaa a ɛsen biara a ɛda nnipa baanu ntam
Indeed some believe that humor can be used as a barometer of marital compatibility
Nokwarem no nnipa bi gye di sɛ wobetumi de aseresɛm adi dwuma te sɛ susudua de ahu fata a awarefo betumi afata wɔn ho wɔn ho
A study on humor found that couples who agree on what s funny are more prone to like love and want to marry each other than those whose humor preferences are less alike
Wohui wɔ nhwehwɛmu bi a wɔyɛe wɔ serew ho mu sɛ awarefo a nneɛma koro na ɛyɛ wɔn serew no taa pɛ wɔn ho wɔdɔ wɔn ho na wɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔware sen wɔn a nneɛma a ɛyɛ wɔn serew sonsonoe
Why ?	Dɛn ntia ?
Because humor is indicative of many things values interests preoccupations intelligence imagination and needs
Efisɛ aseresɛm da nneɛma pii adi nneɛma a ɛsom bo ma obi nea n’ani gye ho ne botae ahorow ne nyansa ne nsusuwii ne n’ahiade
A survey of a thousand U
S
corporations revealed that people with a sense of humor tend to be more creative less rigid and more willing to consider and embrace new ideas and methods

To Laugh or Not to Laugh	Nea Ɛsɛ sɛ Ɛyɛ Yɛn Serew ne Nea Ɛnsɛ sɛ Ɛyɛ Yɛn Serew
No one really knows exactly what makes something funny
Obiara nnim dekode pɔtee a ɛma biribi yɛ serew
Some believe that at the heart of humor is incongruity the bringing of two seemingly incompatible elements together
Ebinom gye di sɛ nneɛma a ɛbɔ abira wɔ aseresɛm mu nneɛma abien a ayɛ sɛ nea ɛne ne ho nhyia a wɔka bom
A grown man dressed as a circus clown may throw a small child into a fit of laughter
Ɔbarima panyin a osiesie ne ho te sɛ kɔnsɛtni bɛma abofra aserew mpofirim
However an adult with his greater life experience and superior cognitive skills may no longer find the clownish antics funny
Nanso ɛrenyɛ obi a wanyin a ɔwɔ asetram osuahu pii na otumi te nneɛma ase yiye no serew
He may find pleasure in more mental forms of humor puns plays on words or jokes that exploit incongruity on a verbal rather than a physical level
Ebia n’ani begye aseresɛm a ɛkanyan adwene kasakoa nsɛmfua bi a wɔka ma ɛyɛ anigye anaa nsɛnkwaa ho kɛse asen ahosiesie no
Some researchers believe that humor may result from the release of pent up emotional energy
Nhwehwɛmufo bi gye di sɛ aseresɛm betumi afi nkate mu nhyɛso mu
Humor may serve to mask tension and pain
Ebia ɔserew bɛkata ɔhaw ne ɛyaw a obi di so
Says the Bible Even in laughter the heart may be in pain and grief is what rejoicing ends up in
Proverbs
Bible ka sɛ Ɔserew mu po koma hu yaw na anigye no awiei yɛ awerɛhow
Mmebusɛm
Many forms of humor involve what is called slapstick
Aseresɛm yi pii fi agoden mu
A man trips or gets doused with water
Ɔbarima bi pori biribi yɛ te sɛ nea ɔrehwe ase anaa ɔtɔ nsu mu ma ne ho fɔw
Funny isn t it ?	So ɛnyɛ serew ?
Perhaps if nobody really gets hurt
Sɛ obiara anhyɛ da ampira a ebia ɛbɛyɛ serew
A Christian takes pains not to cultivate an appetite for sick or sadistic humor
Ɛnsɛ sɛ Kristoni ani gye aseresɛm a ɛho ntew anaa ɛyɛ atirimɔdensɛm ho
After all love does not rejoice over unrighteousness
Efisɛ ɔdɔ ani nnye nea ɛnteɛ ho
’
A Christian also avoids tasteless jokes that put down any nationality or race
Kristoni kwati nsɛnkwaa a ɛkasa tia afoforo na ebu ɔman anaa abusua bi animtiaa nso
He tempers his sense of humor with fellow feeling
Kristoni de tema di dwuma wɔ n’aseresɛm mu
For example it may be delightfully amusing to watch a toddler take a few tentative steps and then collapse in a heap
Sɛ nhwɛso no ebia akokoaa a otutu nkakrankakra na afei ɔhwe ase bɛyɛ anika ankasa
But if an elderly or disabled person falls the appropriate response is to rush to his assistance not to laugh
Nanso sɛ obi a ne mfe akɔ anim anaa wadi dɛm hwe ase a ɛrenyɛ papa sɛ wobɛserew na mmom nea ɛfata sɛ woyɛ ne sɛ wobɛyɛ ntɛm akɔboa no
Humor and Your Health	Aseresɛm ne W’akwahosan
Properly used humor has much value
Aseresɛm som bo kɛse sɛ wɔde di dwuma yiye a
In fact evidence is slowly accumulating that laughter may even serve as a therapeutic tool
Nokwarem no adanse pii reda no adi nkakrankakra sɛ serew betumi asa yare mpo
It is known that the act of laughing gives a healthy massage to one s internal organs
Wɔahu sɛ serew ma nipadua mu akwaa nya ahoɔden
Furthermore according to American Health magazine some researchers think laughter may empower the immune system
Afei nso sɛnea American Health nsɛmma nhoma ka no nhwehwɛmufo bi susuw sɛ serew betumi ama nipadua mu tumi a ɛko tia nyarewa no anya ahoɔden
The magazine then quotes immunologist Lee S
Afei nsɛmma nhoma no fa nipadua mu tumi a ɛko tia nyarewa ho ɔdenimfo Lee S
Berk as saying Negative emotions can manipulate the immune system and it now seems positive ones can do something similar
Berk asɛm ka sɛ Ɛyawdi betumi anya tumi a ɛko tia nyarewa no so tumi na mprempren ɛda adi sɛ anigye nso tumi yɛ saa ara
This underscores the wisdom of the Bible s words A heart that is joyful does good as a curer
Proverbs
Eyi si nyansa a ɛwɔ Bible mu nsɛm yi mu so dua Anigye koma ma ahoɔden

In hopes of utilizing the healing power of humor some hospitals have set up so called laughter rooms in which patients can play games watch funny movies listen to jokes or simply visit with relatives in a more cheerful atmosphere
Bere a ayaresabea ahorow bi ayeyɛ nea wɔfrɛ no ɔserew adan a ayarefo no tumi di agoru wom hwɛ sini ahorow a ɛyɛ serew tie nsɛnkwaa anaa mpo wɔma abusuafo bɛsra wɔn wɔ anigye mu no wɔwɔ anidaso sɛ wobetumi de ayaresa tumi a serew wɔ adi dwuma
Can you put humor to work yourself ?	So wo nso wubetumi ama nnipa aserew ?
Say you have a sick friend or relative in the hospital
Fa no sɛ wowɔ adamfo anaa obusuani bi a ɔyare wɔ ayaresabea
Why not brighten that ailing one s outlook by giving him or her a humorous book or funny card where that would be appropriate ?	Wɔ baabi a ebetumi ayɛ yiye no dɛn nti na womma ɔyarefo no ani nnye denam nhoma anaa krataa bi a ɛka aseresɛm a wode bɛma no so ?

Humor can be put to work within the home

One husband says It s as useful to me as a multipurpose tool is to an auto mechanic because it does so many things
Okunu bi ka sɛ Ɛso wɔ mfaso ma me te sɛ nea adwinnade a wotumi de yɛ nnwuma pii so wɔ mfaso ma afiri dwumfo no
It protects encourages opens up fruitful conversations breaks down preconceived ideas and turns troublesome words into those that are reasonable and considerate

A sense of humor is especially helpful when irritating habits threaten to strain relations
Aseresɛm tumi boa yiye bere a suban ahorow bi a ɛhyɛ abufuw pɛ sɛ ɛsɛe abusuabɔ no
Your son forgets to put his toys away despite repeated admonition to do so
Ɛmfa ho sɛ woakɔ so aka akyerɛ wo babarima mpɛn pii sɛ onyiyi n’agode mfi hɔ no ɔma ne werɛ fi
Your husband leaves his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor

Humor invites people to look at their behavior from a distance and change it
Nanso aseresɛm ma nkurɔfo susuw wɔn nneyɛe ho kɔ akyiri na wɔyɛ nsakrae
This does not mean making fun of the person guilty of the indiscretion
Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wudi onipa a ɔyɛɛ anibiannaso no ho fɛw
That usually brings pain not laughter
Ɛno taa de ɛyaw na ɛba na ɛnyɛ ɔserew
Try directing your humor toward the situation itself
Bɔ mmɔden ma aseresɛm no mfa tebea no ankasa ho
Having a good laugh may do much to ease the tension
Serew a wɔserew pii betumi asiw ɔhaw no ano
Says one wife There are times when my husband sees I m about to get angry and he softens it with some humorous remark or action
Ɔyere bi ka sɛ Ɛtɔ mmere bi a me kunu hu sɛ me bo reyɛ afuw na ɔka aseresɛm bi anaa ɔyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ serew de dwudwo me bo

Then I realize it wasn t that serious after all
Afei mibehu sɛ asɛm no nyɛ aniberesɛm biara
A few words of caution though
Nanso kɔkɔbɔ bi ni
Avoid trying to be funny when a situation calls for seriousness or compassion
Kwati sɛ wubeyi aseresɛm bere a tebea no hwehwɛ sɛ woma w’ani bere anaa woda ayamhyehye adi
Note Proverbs He that is removing a garment on a cold day is as vinegar upon alkali and as a singer with songs upon a gloomy heart
Hyɛ nea Mmebusɛm ka yi nsow Nea ɔto dwom kyerɛ ɔwerɛhowni no te sɛ nea ɔpa ntama awɔwbere mu anaa nsa nyinyanyinya a wɔde gu gyakisi so
Humor should be used only with due discretion so as not to harm emotionally or physically
Ɛsɛ sɛ wode anidahɔ a ɛfata di aseresɛm ho dwuma sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wumpira obi wɔ nkate anaa nipadua mu
Never allow humor to be meanspirited or disrespectful
Mma aseresɛm mmɛyɛ nea ɛfa nsɛnhunu ho anaa nea obu nnim da
This would rule out allowing older children to make their younger siblings the constant butt of jokes
Eyi nti ɛmfata sɛ mmofra a wɔanyinyin bedi wɔn nuanom nkumaa ho fɛw bere nyinaa
Gentle teasing is one thing caustic comments quite another

Marriage mates must also strive to keep humor within bounds not using it as a weapon of criticism or a means of belittling

 A Source of Great Suffering for the Church 	 Nea Ama Asɔre no Rehu Amane 
In his audience with the bishops of eastern Canada John Paul II turned his attention to sexual abuses committed by priests
Pope John Paul II ne asɔfopɔn a wɔwɔ Canada apuei fam nhyiam ase no ɔde n’adwene sii asɔfo a wɔto mmonnaa so
As reported in L Osservatore Romano the pope told the Canadian prelates that the scandal given by those members of the clergy and those Religious who have failed in this regard has been a source of great suffering for the Church in Canada
Sɛnea wɔbɔɔ amanneɛ wɔ atesɛm krataa L’Osservatore Romano mu no pope no ka kyerɛɛ Canada asɔfopɔn no sɛ aniwusɛm a saa asɔfo no ne asɔre mpanyimfo a wɔadi nkogu wɔ eyi mu de aba no ama Asɔre no rehu amane kɛse wɔ Canada
He added that he had prayed for those who have been victims of sexual misconduct as well as for those who have been guilty of it
Ɔde kaa ho sɛ wabɔ mpae ama wɔn a wɔato wɔn mmonnaa no ne wɔn a wobuu saa bra no nyinaa
Some believe that abolishing obligatory celibacy for priests could both contribute to the reduction of scandals connected with sexual abuse by the clergy and resolve the shortage or uneven distribution of priests mentioned by the pope
Ebinom gye di sɛ mmara a ɛhyɛ asɔfo katee ma wodi sigya no a wobeyi afi hɔ no betumi aboa ma aniwusɛm a asɔfo no yɛ a ɛfa mmonnaato ho no so atew na adi asɔfo a wɔn ho ayɛ na anaa wonnya bi mfa wɔn nkɔ mmeae ahorow a pope no kaa ho asɛm no ho dwuma
But according to John Paul II the difficulties involved today in keeping celibacy are not sufficient reason to overturn the Church s conviction regarding its value and appropriateness

Why Drug Addiction ?	Dɛn Nti na Nnubɔne a Wɔde Di Dwuma Ka Nkurɔfo Hɔ ?

But how can parents protect youths from drugs ?	Nanso ɔkwan bɛn so na awofo bɛfa abɔ mmofra ho ban na wɔamfa nnubɔne ?

Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God
Enti obiara a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ wiase adamfo no gyina hɔ sɛ Onyankopɔn tamfo
But if you are emotionally involved with an unbeliever these words may not be so easy to apply
Nanso sɛ wo ne obi a onnye nni anya ayɔnkofa a emu yɛ den a ɛrenyɛ mmerɛw mma wo sɛ wubetumi de saa nsɛm yi adi dwuma
Indeed the idea of breaking off the relationship may overwhelm you
Nokwarem no ebia twa a wo ne onii no betwa ayɔnkofa a ɛte saa mu no bɛyɛ wo den yiye
You may feel virtually torn apart inside
Ebia wubedi ho yaw
How can I stop liking or loving someone ? you may ask
Ebia wubebisa sɛ Mɛyɛ dɛn atumi ayi m’adwene afi obi ho anigye anaa ɔdɔ a manya no so ? ’
The apostle Paul once said I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin s law that is in my members
Ɔsomafo Paulo kae bere bi sɛ Me mu nipa fam de m’ani gye Onyankopɔn mmara ho nanso mihu mmara foforo bi wɔ me honam akwaa mu a ɛne m’adwene mu mmara ko na ɛfa me dommum ma bɔne mmara a ɛwɔ me honam akwaa mu no
Miserable man that I am ! 	Me manehunufo ! 
Like Paul you may be experiencing a struggle with your feelings
Te sɛ Paulo no ebia wo ne wo nkate reko
Yet a number of Christian youths have won this battle and have been as it were snatched out of the fire
Nanso Kristofo mmofra pii adi nkonim wɔ saa ɔko yi mu na sɛnea yɛbɛka no no wɔahwim wɔn afi ogya no mu
’
 Compare Jude
Fa toto Yuda ho
How ?	Wɔ ɔkwan bɛn so ?
By ending destructive relationships before irreparable damage was done
Denam twa a wotwa ayɔnkofa a ebetumi asɛe wɔn no mu ansa na aka akyi no so
Getting Help	Hwehwɛ Mmoa
Mark for example developed what he calls a serious crush on an unbeliever when he was only years old
Sɛ nhwɛso no Mark nyaa sɛnea ɔka no no obi a onnye nni ho anigye a ɛmfata a anibere wom bere a na wadi mfe pɛ no
Rather than seek help he tried to keep his feelings secret
Sɛ anka ɔbɛhwehwɛ mmoa no wanka ho asɛm ankyerɛ obiara
But his feelings for the girl only grew stronger
Nanso abeawa no ho anigye a wanya no mu kɔɔ so yɛɛ den
Soon he was making secret telephone calls to her
Ankyɛ na owiaa ne ho fii ase ne no kasae wɔ telefon so
When she started calling back it was just a matter of time before his parents figured out what was going on
Bere a abeawa no nso fii ase sɛ ɔbɛfrɛ no wɔ telefon so no ankyɛ na n’awofo behuu nea na ɛrekɔ so no
Don t make the same mistake of trying to solve the problem on your own
Nni mfomso koro no ara sɛ w’ankasa wubedi ɔhaw no ho dwuma
Proverbs says He that is trusting in his own heart is stupid but he that is walking in wisdom is the one that will escape
Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Nea ne ho da ne koma so no yɛ ɔkwasea na nea ɔnam nyansa mu no benya aguanye
Really would you be in this situation in the first place if your judgment wasn t somewhat impaired ?	Nokwarem no sɛ ɛnyɛ sɛ wo nsusuwii tɔɔ sin ɔkwan bi so a so anka wobɛba saa tebea yi mu ?
At times our emotions overcome reason and we need the help of someone more clearheaded and objective
Ɛtɔ da bi a yɛn nkate tumi di yɛn nsusuwii so na yebehia obi a n’adwenem da hɔ na ɔka nokware mmoa
Your parents are probably in the best position to help you especially if they are God fearing
Ebia w’awofo ne nkurɔfo a wobetumi aboa wo yiye titiriw sɛ wɔyɛ nkurɔfo a wosuro Onyankopɔn a
Likely they know you better than anyone else does
Ɛtaa ba sɛ wɔne nkurɔfo a wonim wo yiye sen obiara
They were young once and can be helped to understand what you re going through
Wɔayɛ mmofra pɛn na ɛno betumi aboa wɔn ma wɔate tebea a wowom no ase
At Proverbs the Bible writer Solomon exhorts My son do give your heart to me and may those eyes of yours take pleasure in my own ways
Bible kyerɛwfo Salomo tu fo wɔ Mmebusɛm sɛ Me ba fa wo koma ma me na ma m’akwan nsɔ w’ani
Why not give your heart to your parents and let them know you need help ?	Dɛn nti na womfa wo koma mma w’awofo na womma wonhu sɛ wuhia mmoa ?
Young Jim did that very thing
Abofra Jim yɛɛ saa
He was in the throes of a strong infatuation with a girl at school
Na wanya abeawa bi ho anigye kɛse wɔ sukuu a ɔnte ase
He says I finally asked my parents for help
Ɔka sɛ Awiei koraa no mehwehwɛɛ mmoa fii m’awofo hɔ
This was a key to my overcoming these feelings
Eyi ne ade a ɛmaa mitumi dii saa nkate no so
They helped me a lot
Wɔboaa me yiye
Having experienced his parents loving support Jim gives this advice I think other young Christians should not hesitate to talk to their parents
Bere a Jim anya n’awofo mmoa a efi ɔdɔ mu no otu fo sɛ Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ Kristofo mmofra foforo twentwɛn wɔn nan ase sɛ wɔne wɔn awofo bɛkasa
Communicate with them
Mo ne wɔn mmɔ nkɔmmɔ
They will understand you
Wɔbɛte mo ase
In a similar situation a youth named Andrew availed himself of yet another avenue of help
Saa pɛpɛɛpɛ na abofra bi a wɔfrɛ no Andrew hwehwɛɛ mmoa wɔ ɔkwan foforo so
Regarding his attendance at a local circuit assembly of Jehovah s Witnesses he says One of the talks hit me
Ɛdefa Yehowa Adansefo ɔmansin nhyiam a wɔyɛe wɔ baabi a ɔte a ɔkɔɔ bi ho no ɔka sɛ Ɔkasa horow no mu biako kaa me ma misusuw nsɛm ho anibere so
The circuit overseer gave strong counsel against developing relationships with members of the opposite sex who are not Christians
Ɔmansin sohwɛfo no de afotu a emu yɛ den mae wɔ ayɔnkofa a yɛne wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu a wɔnyɛ Kristofo benya no ho
I knew I had to correct my thinking right away
Mihui sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ mesakra m’adwene amonom hɔ ara
So what did he do ?	Enti dɛn na ɔyɛe ?
First he talked to his mother a single parent and benefited from her advice
Nea edi kan no ɔne ne maame a ɔno nkutoo ne ne wofo a ɔne no te no kasae na n’afotu no so baa no mfaso
Then he also approached an elder in the local congregation of Jehovah s Witnesses who was able to render follow up assistance
Afei ɔkɔɔ ɛhɔ Yehowa Adansefo asafo no mu panyin bi nkyɛn nso na ɔkɔɔ so boaa no bere ne bere mu
Congregation elders can be like a hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm for distressed ones
Asafo mu mpanyimfo betumi ayɛ sɛ mframa ano hintabea ne osu ano guankɔbea ama wɔn a wɔahaw
Why not approach one of them and let him know what is troubling you ?	Dɛn nti na wommɛn wɔn mu biako na womma onhu nea ɛrehaw wo ?
Making a Clean Break	Ayɔnkofa no a Wubetwam Koraa Prɛko Pɛ
When Mark s parents discovered his secret relationship they reacted immediately
Bere a Mark awofo huu n’ayɔnkofa a ɔde sie wɔn no wodii ho dwuma ntɛm so
They were very direct in telling me to stop this relationship says Mark
Mark ka sɛ Wɔka kyerɛɛ me pen sɛ mintwa ayɔnkofa no mu
My initial reaction was rebellious
Metew atua mfiase no
We exchanged words loudly and I shut myself in my room
Yedii anobaabae gyegyeegye na metoo me ho pon mu
But soon reality set in and I realized the girl and I had different goals
Nanso ankyɛ na mifii ase susuw asɛm no mu nokwasɛm ho na mibehui sɛ na me ne abeawa no botae ahorow nhyia
It was not going to work
Na yɛn abusuabɔ no renyɛ yiye
Yes meditating on the realities of the situation can help cool off your feelings
Yiw tebea no ho nokwasɛm a wubesusuw ho betumi abrɛ wo nkate horow ase
Ask yourself Does this person share my goals my convictions my moral standards ?	Bisa wo ho sɛ So saa nipa no ne me wɔ botae gyidi gyinapɛn koro ?
Were we to marry would this person support my efforts to worship God ?	Sɛ yɛware a so saa nipa yi bɛyɛ me mmoa wɔ mmɔden a mebɔ sɛ mɛsom Onyankopɔn no mu ?
Does this person share my enthusiasm for spiritual things ?	So n’ani gye honhom mu nneɛma ho te sɛ me ?
Really what harmony could there be in such a relationship ? Compare Corinthians
Nokwarem no biakoyɛ bɛn na ebetumi aba abusuabɔ a ɛte saa mu ? ’ Fa toto Korintofo ho
Making a clean break will not be easy though
Nanso ayɔnkofa no a wubetwam koraa prɛko pɛ no nyɛ mmerɛw
Monique mentioned at the outset admits I tried on two occasions to break off the relationship but unsuccessfully
Monique a yɛkaa ne ho asɛm mfiase no gye tom sɛ Mebɔɔ mmɔden mpɛn abien sɛ metwa ayɔnkofa no mu koraa nanso anyɛ yiye
I didn t want to let him go completely
Mampɛ sɛ me ne no begyae fekubɔ koraa
I tried witnessing to him hoping he would accept Jehovah
Mebɔɔ mmɔden dii no adanse a na mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɔbɛsom Yehowa
He even came to a Sunday meeting once
Ɔbaa Kwasida nhyiam ase bere bi ase mpo
But he had no real interest in Jehovah
Nanso na n’ani nnye Yehowa ho ankasa
I realized that the proper course was to let him go completely
Mihui sɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ara ne sɛ me ne no betwam koraa
This reminds us of Jesus words at Matthew
Eyi kae yɛn Yesu nsɛm a ɛwɔ Mateo no
There he spoke about things that could hinder one s entrance into God s Kingdom things that might be as dear as a right hand
Ɛhɔ no ɔkaa nneɛma a ebetumi asiw obi kwan ma ɔnkɔ Onyankopɔn Ahenni mu ho asɛm nneɛma a ɛsom bo ma obi te sɛ ne nsa nifa
Even so Jesus advised Cut it off and throw it away from you
For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost than for your whole body to land in Gehenna a symbol of eternal destruction
Ɛno ho mpo no Yesu tuu fo sɛ Twa na tow fi wo ho kyene na eye ma wo sɛ wo ho akwaa mu biako bɛsɛe na wɔamfa wo nipadua nyinaa ankɔto Gehenna daa ɔsɛe ho sɛnkyerɛnne
In harmony with this principle courageously approach the person with whom you are involved and speak truth
Nea ɛne nnyinasosɛm yi hyia no kɔ onipa a wo ne no anya ayɔnkofa no nkyɛn akokoduru so na ka nokware kyerɛ no
In a public setting not alone or in a romantic situation let him or her know in no uncertain terms that the relationship is over
Wɔ baguam ɛnyɛ sɛ wo ne no nkutoo hyɛ baabi anaa bere a morewewe na ma no nte ase pefee sɛ mo ayɔnkofa no aba awiei
Young Sheila recalls What worked for me was taking definite action
Abeawa Sheila ka sɛ Nea ɛboaa me ne gyinae pintinn a misii
No more lunches together
Me ne no annidi ammom awia bere bio
No more seeing each other during study periods
Manhwehwɛ n’akyi kwan wɔ sukuu adesua bere bio
I made my position clear to him
Memaa ohuu me gyinae a masi no pefee
A Christian girl named Pam was equally blunt I finally told him to leave me alone and I just ignored him
Kristoni abeawa bi a wɔfrɛ no Pam nso daa ne gyinae a wasi adi pefee Awiei koraa no meka kyerɛɛ no sɛ onnyae m’akyi di na me nso migyaee n’akyi di
Getting Over the Pain	Ɛyaw no So a Wubedi
In the aftermath of such a breakup you may feel like the psalmist who said I have become disconcerted I have bowed low to an extreme degree all day long I have walked about sad
Wɔ ntetewmu a ɛte saa akyi no ebia wobɛte nka te sɛ odwontofo a ɔkaa eyi no Mapompono na mapua koraa da mu nyinaa mede awerɛhow menam foofoo
Some period of grieving is only natural
Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ edu bere bi a wo werɛ bɛhow
The Bible acknowledges that there is a time to weep
Bible no gye tom sɛ osu wɔ ne bere
But you need not grieve forever
Nanso ɛnyɛ daa na wubedi awerɛhow
The pain will diminish in time
Bere kɔ so no ɛyaw no so bɛtew
Yes admits Mark I did go through a grief period
Mark gye tom sɛ Yiw midii awerɛhow bere bi
My parents sensed this and increased my associations with other Christian youths
M’awofo huu eyi na wɔmaa me ne Kristofo mmofra afoforo bɔɔ fekuw kɛse
This was very helpful
Eyi boaa me yiye
Andrew who similarly felt depressed after his breakup says The elders helped
Andrew a ɔno nso hawee wɔ ne ntetewmu no akyi ka sɛ Mpanyimfo no boae
I also got more involved in the preaching work and got close to some Christian brothers with whom I had a good rapport
Mede me ho hyɛɛ asɛnka adwuma mu pii na mebɛn Kristofo anuanom binom a m’ani gyee wɔn fekubɔ ho kɛse nso
Yes get busy in spiritual works
Yiw yɛ honhom fam nnwuma pii
Some physical activity or exercise may also help
Honam fam adwuma anaa apɔwmu teɛteɛ binom nso betumi aboa
Avoid solitude
Ntew wo ho
Keep your mind on things that are cheerful and upbuilding
Philippians
Dwennwen nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye na ɛma nkɔso ho
Filipifo
Remember too that Jehovah will be pleased with your courageous stand
Kae nso sɛ Yehowa ani begye gyinae a woasi no akokoduru so no ho
Feel free to go to him in prayer for help and support
Fa adwenemtew kɔ n’anim wɔ mpaebɔ mu kɔhwehwɛ mmoa ne nkuranhyɛ
I engaged in a lot of prayer recalls young Sheila
Abeawa Sheila ka sɛ Mede me ho hyɛɛ mpaebɔ mu kɛse
No it is not easy to end a harmful relationship
Nokwarem ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wubetwa ayɔnkofa bɔne mu
Admits Sheila Even though it s over I sometimes think about him and wonder what he is doing
Sheila gye tom sɛ Ɛwom mpo sɛ yɛn ayɔnkofa no aba awiei de nanso ɛtɔ da bi a misusuw ne ho na midwen nea ɔreyɛ ho
But you stick to your resolve knowing you are pleasing Jehovah
Nanso wobata wo gyinaesi ho pintinn bere a wunim sɛ ɛno sɔ Yehowa ani no

Let the person know in no uncertain terms that the relationship is over	Ma onipa no nhu pefee sɛ mo ayɔnkofa no aba awiei
The Bible s Viewpoint	Bible no Adwene
Does the Bible Discourage Freedom of Thought ?	So Bible no Kasa Tia Ankorankoro Adwene a Wɔde Susuw Nsɛm Ho ?
THE flames leap heavenward as the bonfire devours precious books fed to it by German officials
OGYATANNAA no dɛw kɔ soro bere a ɛhyew nhoma a ɛsom bo a Germany aban mpanyimfo atow agu mu no
A scene from Nazi Germany ?	So eyi yɛ asɛm a esii wɔ Germany Nasifo bere so ?
Yes but it could also be a scene from the year when a Roman Catholic archbishop ordered all German language Bibles burned
Yiw nanso ebetumi ayɛ asɛm a esii afe bere a Roma Katolek ɔsɔfopɔn bi hyɛe sɛ wɔnhyew German kasa mu Bible nyinaa no
Actually incidents of book burning a universal symbol of the suppression of freedom of thought and speech have occurred in many countries and in many centuries
Nokwarem no nhoma a wɔhyew amansan sɛnkyerɛnne a ɛkyerɛ sɛ wɔmma obi mfa n’adwene nyɛ nea ɔpɛ akɔ so wɔ aman pii mu wɔ mfehaha pii mu
Often it has been instigated by religious leaders who feared the effect that freedom of thought would have on the common man
Mpɛn pii no nyamesom akannifo a na wosuro nea mpapahwekwa a wɔbɛma wɔde wɔn adwene ayɛ nea wɔpɛ no de bɛba na na wɔhyɛ akyi
No wonder that many today assume that the Bible mandates rigid restrictions against open intellectual inquiry
Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɛnnɛ nnipa pii afa no sɛ Bible bara nneɛma nyinaa ho nimdeɛ a obi bɛhwehwɛ katee
But does it really ?	Nanso so ɛte saa ankasa ?
Does the Bible encourage restraints on freedom of thought ?	So Bible no mma kwan sɛ obi de n’adwene bɛyɛ nea ɔpɛ ?
 Love Jehovah With Your Whole Mind 	 Fa W’adwene Nyinaa Dɔ Yehowa ’
The Bible does not discourage the use of the mind
Bible no nkasa ntia obi adwene a ɔde bedi dwuma
In fact Jesus encouraged each of us to love Jehovah with our whole mind
Nokwarem no Yesu hyɛɛ yɛn mu biara nkuran sɛ yemfi yɛn adwene nyinaa mu nnɔ Yehowa
’
His ministry shows that he had a keen interest in current events biology agriculture and human nature
Ne som adwuma no kyerɛ sɛ na n’ani gye ho yiye sɛ obehu wiase nsɛm a ɛresisi abɔde a nkwa wom ho nimdeɛ kuayɛ ho nsɛm ne sɛnea nnipa su te
His illustrations indicate that he clearly understood the principles in God s Word and the background and thinking of his listeners and that he thought carefully about how to bring the two together
Ne mfatoho ahorow no da no adi sɛ na ɔwɔ Onyankopɔn Asɛm no mu nnyinasosɛm ahorow ne n’atiefo amammerɛ ne wɔn nsusuwii ho ntease kɛse na ɔde ahwɛyiye susuw ɔkwan a obetumi afa so ama Bible no afa wɔn ho ho
Paul entreated all Christians to render their service to God with their power of reason
Paulo tuu Kristofo nyinaa fo sɛ womfi wɔn adwene mu mfa wɔn som mma Onyankopɔn
He encouraged the Thessalonians not to let misleading inspired expressions shake them from their reason
Ɔhyɛɛ Tesalonikafo no nkuran sɛ wɔmmma nnaadaasɛm a wɔnam ahonhommɔne so ka nnnan wɔn adwene
’
He had some knowledge of Greek and Cretan poetry and military equipment and procedures
Na ɔwɔ Helafo ne Kretafo anwensɛm ne asraafo nneɛma ne wɔn dwumadi ho nimdeɛ
And he was observant of local customs
Acts
Afei nso ɔhyɛɛ amammerɛ a ɛwɔ aman ahorow mu nsow
Asomafo no Nnwuma
Although Jesus and Paul enjoyed so much freedom of thought they did not view themselves as the sole authority on right and wrong
Ɛwom sɛ Yesu ne Paulo de wɔn adwene susuw nneɛma pii ho de nanso wɔammu wɔn ho sɛ wɔn na wɔwɔ tumi sɛ wɔkyerɛ nea eye ne nea enye nyinaa
Rather than reject the Bible in favor of his own reasoning Jesus repeatedly quoted from the Scriptures
Sɛ anka Yesu de n’ankasa nsusuwii bedi Bible no so no ɔfaa Kyerɛwnsɛm no mu nsɛm kae mpɛn pii
His swift and severe reply when Peter urged him to consider a course different from the sacrificial death that was God s will for him shows that he would not even contemplate that line of thinking
Mmuae a emu yɛ den a ɔde maa Petro ntɛmso bere a ɔhyɛɛ no sɛ ɔnkwati owu a na Onyankopɔn pɛ sɛ owu de bɔ afɔre no kyerɛ sɛ saa adwene no amma ne tirim mpo
Similarly Paul told the Corinthians When I came to you it was not with any show of oratory or philosophy but simply to tell you what God had guaranteed
Saa ara na Paulo ka kyerɛɛ Korintofo no sɛ Bere a mebaa mo nkyɛn no mamfa anotew anaa nyansapɛ ammɛhoahoa me ho na mmom nea Onyankopɔn asi so dua kɛkɛ na mebɛka kyerɛɛ mo
Like Jesus his reasoning was based solidly on the Scriptures
Acts 	Te sɛ Yesu no na ne nsusuwii gyina Kyerɛwnsɛm no so koraa
Asomafo no Nnwuma
The Bible encourages the use of one s mental faculties to the full but not without all restraint
Bible no hyɛ obi adwene a ɔde bedi dwuma akosi ase ho nkuran nanso ɛsɛ sɛ anohyeto ba mu
However the burden of responsibility for keeping our thinking in harmony with that of Jehovah is placed on the individual Christian not the congregation
Nanso ɛnyɛ asafo no na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhwɛ ma yɛn nsusuwii ne Yehowa de hyia na mmom Kristoni ankorankoro biara
Thus when a number of Ephesians publicly renounced their practice of spiritism and became Christians Paul did not take it upon himself to burn their books but a number of them who had practised magic collected their books and made a bonfire of them in public
Enti bere a Efesofo dodow bi gyaee wɔn ahonhonsɛmdi wɔ baguam bɛyɛɛ Kristofo no Paulo amfa anto ne ho so sɛ ɔbɛhyew wɔn nhoma ahorow no na mmom wɔn a wɔyɛ asumanne no dodow bi boaboaa wɔn nhoma ahorow no ano na wɔhyew no baguam
Why did these Christians feel it necessary to burn their own books ?	Dɛn nti na saa Kristofo yi tee nka sɛ ɛho hia sɛ wɔhyew wɔn ankasa nhoma ahorow no ?
The First Line of Defense	Ahobammɔ Kwan a Edi Kan
Consider this illustration
Susuw mfatoho yi ho
A successful military defense often involves several lines of defensive bulwarks
Mpɛn pii no wɔkyekyɛ asraafo dɔm mu pii de bɔ ɔman ho ban wɔ ɔko mu
No successful general would feel that any one of these is unimportant and should be given up without a fight
Ɔsahene a ne ho akokwaw biara nni hɔ a ɔbɛte nka sɛ afa ahorow yi bi ho nhia nti ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔko bɔ ho ban
In a Christian s fight against sin there are several lines of defense as well
Ahobammɔ akwan pii wɔ ɔko a Kristoni ko tia bɔne no nso mu
James states that each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire
Then the desire when it has become fertile gives birth to sin
Yakobo ka sɛ wɔsɔ obiara hwɛ a na ɛyɛ n’ankasa akɔnnɔ a egyigye na ɛdaadaa no na ɛsɔ no hwɛ ansa na akɔnnɔ no nyinsɛn a ɛwo bɔne
The first step toward sin is the cultivation of a wrong desire in the mind
Ade a edi kan a obi yɛ ansa na wayɛ bɔne ne akɔnnɔ bɔne a osusuw ho wɔ n’adwene mu
Thus the first line of defense is to refrain from cultivating the desire to control one s thinking
Enti ahobammɔ kwan a edi kan ne sɛ obi bɛkwati sɛ obenya akɔnnɔ ɔbɛhyɛ ne nsusuwii so
It is because of this link between thoughts and actions that the Bible warns us Keep your minds fixed on the things above not on the things upon the earth
Ɛyɛ abusuabɔ a ɛda nsusuwii ne nneyɛe mu yi nti na Bible no bɔ kɔkɔ sɛ Munnwen nea ɛwɔ soro na ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ asase so
When Christians refuse to dwell mentally on immorality spiritism or apostasy they make this decision not because they fear that these ideas might prove superior to Bible truths but because they wish to avoid anything that could draw them into a sinful course
Sɛ Kristofo pow sɛ wɔde wɔn adwene besi ɔbrasɛe ahonhonsɛmdi anaa ɔwae so a ɛnyɛ sɛ wosuro sɛ saa nsusuwii no betumi adi Bible nokware so nti na wosi saa gyinae yi na mmom wɔpɛ sɛ wɔkwati biribiara a ebetumi atwetwe wɔn akɔ bɔne mu ntia
All Things Are Openly Exposed 	 Ade Nyinaa so Abue ’
Another important reason why we should control our thinking is our love for Jehovah and a respect for his ability to know our thoughts
Ade titiriw foforo nti a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛhyɛ yɛn nsusuwii so ne ɔdɔ a yɛwɔ ma Yehowa ne obu a yɛkyerɛ wɔ yɛn nsusuwii a otumi hu no ho
Imagine that you had a cherished friend or a close relative who was particularly sensitive to dirt or dust
Fa no sɛ wowɔ adamfo bi a wopɛ n’asɛm paa anaa obusuani bi a ɔbɛn wo a ne ho mpɛ fi anaa mfuturu koraa
Would you stop inviting your friend into your home unwilling to do the extra cleaning that your house would require ?	So worento nsa mfrɛ w’adamfo no mma wo fie bio esiane sɛ wompɛ sɛ wotew wo fie hɔ kakra ka ho nti ?
Would love not move you to make the needed extra effort to keep things clean ?	So ɔdɔ renka wo mma wommɔ wo ho mmɔden kakra sɛnea ɛsɛ mfa nsiesie hɔ ?
Jehovah s sensitivity to our innermost thoughts is shown at Psalm He is aware of the secrets of the heart
Dwom kyerɛ sɛnea Yehowa ani wɔ yɛn komam nsusuwii so no Onim komam ahintasɛm
Paul said we are accountable for those thoughts There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting
Hebrews Psalm Proverbs
Paulo kae sɛ yebebu saa nsusuwii no ho akontaa Enni abɔde biara a ɛnna adi n’anim na ade nyinaa ho da hɔ na ɛso abue nea yɛne no wɔ asɛm no anim
Hebrifo Dwom Mmebusɛm
Job acknowledged man s responsibility to God for his thoughts
Hiob gye toom sɛ onipa bebu ne nsusuwii ho akontaa akyerɛ Onyankopɔn
Job
offered up burnt sacrifices
for said Job maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart
Hiob
kɔbɔɔ ɔhyew afɔre
efisɛ Hiob kae sɛ Ebia me mma no ayɛ bɔne na wɔadome Onyankopɔn wɔn koma mu
Willful contemplation of a wrong course could in itself be viewed by Jehovah as a sin
Compare Exodus
Yehowa betumi abu bɔne a obi hyɛ da susuw ho kɛkɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne
Fa toto Exodus ho
True Freedom of Thought	Ahofadi a Edi Mu a Yɛde Besusuw Nsɛm Ho
The Bible encourages each Christian to set as a goal the bringing of every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ
Bible no hyɛ Kristoni biara nkuran sɛ ɔmfa nyɛ ne botae sɛ ɔbɛfa adwene nyinaa nnommum de ahyɛ Kristo asoɔmmerɛw ase
’
This is achieved not through restrictions placed by religious leaders but through an individual s exercise of self control and through his love for and understanding of Jehovah and His principles
Ɛnyɛ anohyeto a nyamesom akannifo de to nkurɔfo so na wɔnam so yɛ eyi na mmom wɔnam ahosodi ne Yehowa ne Ne nnyinasosɛm ahorow ho dɔ ne ntease a ankorankoro biara benya so
With the achievement of this goal comes true freedom of thought limited only by godly standards and enhanced by the joy of knowing that even in our thoughts we are pleasing to Jehovah
Sɛ yetumi yɛ saa a yebetumi de yɛn adwene ayɛ nea yɛpɛ ankasa a Onyankopɔn nnyinasosɛm nkutoo na ɛto ano hye na nea ɛhyɛ mu den ne nim a yenim sɛ wɔ yɛn nsusuwii mpo mu no yɛsɔ Yehowa ani

Do You Suffer With Back Pain ?	So W’akyi Tutu Wo ?
 The pain was horrible

When the pain is recurrent and unremitting it can affect employment income family and one s role in the family producing emotional suffering as well

Physical pain induces anxiety and depression that may in turn lead to even more intense and persistent pain

For example a young parent or breadwinner may have to deal with pressure from job family and friends because of the disability that can result from back problems

Although back pain that is persistent can signal many internal diseases this discussion will focus on two sources of back pain herniated disks and muscle spasms
Ɛwom sɛ akyi yaw a ennyae betumi ayɛ nipadua mu nyarewa ahorow ho sɛnkyerɛnne de nanso yɛde yɛn adwene besi nneɛma abien a ɛde akyi yaw ba so wɔ yɛn nkɔmmɔbɔ yi mu akyi berɛmo mu nnompe a ɛto fere ho ne ntini a ɛtwetwe pua
Herniated disks are a major cause of back disease among young and middle aged adults
Akyi berɛmo mu nnompe a ɛto fere ho ne ade titiriw a ɛde berɛmo mu nyarewa ba mmofra ne mmerante ne mmabaa so
Such disks are often referred to as slipped disks a misnomer since they cannot be slipped in or out of place
Wɔtaa frɛ nnompe a ɛtete saa no sɛ nnompe a ato afere ho na ɛyɛ din a ɛmfata efisɛ nnompe no ntumi nto mfere ho anaa emfi mmeae a ɛhyehyɛ no
By the time a person reaches his s the spongy interior of the disks begins to lose its elasticity and moisture causing the disk to shrink
Sɛ obi du ne mfe mu a na biribi a ɛte sɛ sapɔw a ɛwɔ nnompe no mu no afi ase rehwere twann a ɛyɛ no ne nsu a ɛwom no na ɛma dompe no pua
But this does not usually result in pain

For some people however intense pain occurs when part of the spongy interior herniates or bulges through the outer ring of fibrous tissue
Nanso wɔ nnipa binom fam no ɛyaw a emu yɛ den no ba bere a ade a ɛte sɛ sapɔw no to fere ho anaa ɛma ne ho so fa ntini nketenkete no ntokuru mu no
Fortune magazine comments regarding the disks Once they ve degenerated past a certain point the slightest stress something as trivial as a sneeze or bending over to move a stereo can be the straw that breaks them

Disks act as shock absorbers between the first vertebrae or bones of the spine

These bones are stacked atop one another and form a vertical tunnel the spinal canal through which the spinal cord runs
Saa nnompe yi tataa so ma ɛyɛ biribi te sɛ tokuru donkudonku bi ɛkwan a berɛmo no mu ehon ntini kɛse no fa mu
Between each pair of vertebrae there is a small opening through which a bundle of nerves called a nerve root leaves the canal one bundle on either side
Akwan nketenkete bi deda nnompe a ɛtataa so no mu biara ntam a ntini bi a wɔfrɛ nerve root ehon ntini nketenkete fi mu puepue wɔ benkum ne nifa so
A disk may herniate and press against a particular nerve
Dompe twintwann bi betumi ato afere ho na amia ntini bi
This pressure can interrupt nerve signals that convey sensations to and from other parts of the body
Mia a saa dompe no mia ntini no betumi asiw nsɛnkyerɛnne a edi akɔneaba a ɛde nkate fa ntini no mu kɔ nipadua no afa horow no kwan
A very painful condition known as sciatica for example can occur if there is pressure exerted on the roots of the sciatic nerve
Sɛ nhwɛso no ɛyaw bi a emu yɛ den a wɔfrɛ no sciatica sisiyare tumi ba sɛ dompe bi mia ehon ntini a ɛkɔ asrɛ ne anantu mu no a
Several that emerge from the lower part of the spine form the sciatic nerve
Ehon ntini pii a epuepue fi akyi berɛmo nnompe mu wɔ sisi akyi no na ɛka bom yɛ sisi akyi ntini no
There is one on each side running down the back of each thigh as far as the knee and then branching into other nerves
Ntini bi pue fi nnompe no benkum ne nifa so a ɛsa mu kɔfa asrɛ no mu kodu anankoroma mu na afei ɛkɔbɔ ntini afoforo mu
Sciatic pain usually begins in the low back and shoots out into the hip and buttock and on down the back of the thigh sometimes as far as the calf and foot
Sisiyare taa fi ase wɔ sisi akyi na atrɛw akɔ sisi ne ɛto no mu na asian akɔ srɛ mu na ɛtɔ da bi a ɛkɔ akyiri araa kodu nantu ne nantabon mu
As a result a person may experience foot drop a condition in which the foot drags because the leg muscles cannot raise the toes
Ne saa nti ebia onipa bi ntumi ntu ne nan yiye esiane sɛ ne nan no mu ntini ntumi mma nansoaa no so nti
A sufferer may also experience sensations of pins and needles numbness and muscular weakness in the affected leg

If the disk presses on nerve roots in the cauda equina a group of nerves just below the waist that service the bladder and the bowels a person may have problems urinating or defecating

Persons with any of these symptoms should consult a doctor immediately as they may be signs of serious neurological problems

When contracted and relaxed the muscles in the back join the ligaments in supporting roles keeping the spine from collapsing and enabling it to bend and twist
Sɛ epua na emu gow a ntini a ɛwɔ berɛmo mu no bɛka ntini a ɛsosɔ mpɔw so no ho na ɛma berɛmo nnompe no tumi gyina na ɛma etumi konton na ɛdannan
Under strain however an out of shape muscle can go into a spasm tensing up so much that it becomes a hard lump
Nanso sɛ wɔtwe mu a ntini a enni ahoɔden no san pua na ɛyɛ den araa ma ɛbɔ tɔw denneennen
Occurring without warning and temporarily immobilizing a person episodes of back spasms can be agonizing
Esiane sɛ ɛba mpofirim na ɛka onipa no to hɔ kakra nti w’akyi betumi ayɛ wo yaw yiye
One sufferer describes the pain as a series of earthquakes erupting in your back
Obi a ebi ayɛ no ka ho asɛm sɛ w’akyi turuw te sɛ asasewosow
Doctors agree that muscle spasms occur to guard a person from incurring further damage to weakened muscles
Dɔktafo gye tom sɛ ntini a epua ma w’akyi yɛ wo yaw no bɔ wo ho ban na woansɛe ntini a agow no ankɔ akyiri
A Time Life book The Fit Back observes By immobilizing the back the spasm forces you to take the best course of action and lie down
Time Life adwuma no nhoma The Fit Back ka sɛ W’akyi a ɛyɛ wo yaw a ɛmma wuntumi nyɛ hwee no hyɛ wo ma woda hɔ na eyi ne ade a nyansa wom sɛ woyɛ
This position not only places the least amount of stress on your back but it allows inflamed tissue to repair itself
Da a wobɛda hɔ no bɛma w’akyi adwo wo na ama ntini no nso asiesie ne ho nso
In order to prevent back strain that often triggers spasms the muscles of the back abdomen and thighs need to stay toned and firm
Nea ɛbɛyɛ a w’akyi nyɛ wo yaw no ɛsɛ sɛ woma ntini ahorow a ɛwɔ w’akyi wo yafunum ne w’asrɛ mu no teɛ na ɛyɛ den
Lax abdominal muscles for example may create back strain because they do not give proper support and are less able to resist the pull of the body s weight on the spine
Sɛ nhwɛso no yafunum ntini a epuapua betumi ama w’akyi ayɛ wo yaw efisɛ sɛ ɛba saa a entumi mfa mmoa mma akyi ntini no na enni ahoɔden a ebetumi de agyina kuntun a nipadua no kuntun ne mu pagya nneɛma no ano
If abdominal muscles are well conditioned they create a muscular girdle that prevents the lower back from arching into a swaybacked position
Sɛ yafunum ntini ahorow no wɔ ahoɔden a ɛyɛ te sɛ ntini abɔso a ɛmma sisi nkuntun nkyeakyea

What You Can Do to Ease Pain	Nea Wubetumi Ayɛ De Adwudwo Ɛyaw Ano
Poor posture obesity weak muscles and stress are four factors that contribute to the likelihood of pain in the lower back
Gyina a wonnyina hɔ yiye kɛseyɛ mmoroso ntini a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ne adwennwen ne nneɛma anan a ebetumi ama obi sisi ayɛ no yaw
Common activities that are done improperly such as sitting standing or lifting are other predisposing factors
Nneɛma a yɛtaa yɛ a yɛnyɛ no yiye te sɛ ntrase nnyinahɔ anaa ade so ma yɛ nneɛma afoforo a ɛde ba
A mutual relationship exists between good posture and strong abdominal and back muscles
Abusuabɔ pa bi da gyina a wogyina hɔ anaa wɔtra ase yiye ne yafunum ne akyi berɛmo mu ntini a ɛyɛ den ntam
Correct posture allows the muscles to work properly while good muscle tone is vital for proper posture
Gyina a wogyina hɔ yiye ma ntini no yɛ adwuma yiye na saa ara na ntini a ɛtene ho hia na wɔatumi agyina hɔ anaa wɔatra ase yiye
An alignment that follows the spine s natural S curve is required for good posture
Sɛnea wɔahyehyɛ berɛmo nnompe no na ama atumi akuntun ayɛ sɛ S no hwehwɛ sɛ obi gyina hɔ anaa ɔtra ase yiye
It does not mean a rigidly straight spine

If improper posture is corrected pain of postural origin can be eliminated indicates Robin McKenzie in the book Treat Your Own Back adding As time passes however if uncorrected the habitual poor posture causes changes to the structure of the joints excessive wear occurs and premature ageing of the joints is a consequence
Robin McKenzie ka wɔ nhoma Treat Your Own Back mu sɛ wɔyɛ nsiesie gyina hɔ yiye a ɛyaw a efi gyina a wonnyina hɔ yiye mu ba no betumi afi hɔ na ɔde ka ho sɛ Nanso bere a bere kɔ so no sɛ wɔannyɛ nsakrae annyina hɔ yiye a sɛnea wɔahyehyɛ nnompe no sakra ɛma apɔw so hi kɛse na nea efi mu ba ne apɔw so a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ntɛm
Excess weight especially in the abdomen can also strain the back because it creates a gravitational pull on the muscles that support the back
Sɛ obi mu yɛ duru boro so a titiriw sɛ ne yafunu so a ebetumi ama n’akyi ayɛ no yaw efisɛ ɛtwetwe ntini a ekura berɛmo no mu no
A regular exercise program is a key to a fit and healthy back
Apɔwmu teɛteɛ a wɔtaa yɛ yɛ ade a ɛma obi nya akyi berɛmo a ahoɔden wom
Even if pain is no longer experienced exercise is essential because back pain that has gone away tends to resurface unexpectedly
Sɛ wɔnte ɛyaw bio mpo a apɔwmu teɛteɛ ho hia efisɛ berɛmo mu ɛyaw a egyae no tumi san ba mpofirim
A complete medical evaluation is recommended before beginning a program
Wɔkamfo kyerɛ sɛ wɔmma dɔktafo nyɛ nhwehwɛmu wɔ nipadua no mu ansa wɔafi apɔwmu teɛteɛ no ase
A doctor may suggest the proper exercises for an individual s back problem or he may refer a patient to a physical therapist

Many researchers believe that stress can also make a person vulnerable to back trouble
Nhwehwɛmufo pii gye di sɛ adwennwen nso tumi ma obi akyi yɛ no yaw
Stress may trigger spasms in some people because unrelieved tension tightens muscles resulting in back pain
Adwennwen betumi ama ebinom ate ɛyaw efisɛ adwennwen a emfi hɔ ma ntini mu yare na ɛde akyi yaw ba
Managing or eliminating sources of stress can help reduce the risk of back pain
Nneɛma a ɛde adwennwen ba a wobedi ho dwuma yiye anaa wobeyi afi hɔ no boa ma berɛmo mu yaw a obi betumi anya no so tew
People who spend a great deal of time sitting at work or when traveling for long distances may experience back strain
Ebia nkurɔfo a wɔde bere pii tra ase wɔ adwumam anaa wotutu akwan atenten bɛte ɛyaw wɔ wɔn akyi
Much more weight is exerted on the lower back when sitting according to a Swedish study

A Life Without Pain ?	Asetra a Ɛyaw Nnim ?
In the face of such stark reality it may appear rash to suggest the possibility of life without pain

Therefore what the Bible says may seem farfetched namely God will wipe out every tear from their eyes
neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore
Revelation

Anatomist Allan Basbaum said Not to have pain at all is a disaster
Nipadua akwaa ho ɔdenimfo Allan Basbaum kae sɛ Ɛyɛ ade bɔne sɛ wonte ɛyaw koraa
If you were unable to feel pain you would probably not notice that you had developed a blister until it became a badly ulcerated sore

According to a news report the parents of one little girl who felt no pain would sometimes smell burning flesh and find her casually leaning against the stove

Is this a promise we should really want fulfilled ?	So eyi yɛ bɔhyɛ a yɛbɛpɛ sɛ enya mmamu ankasa ?
A Life Without Tears ?	Asetra a Osu Nnim ?
Note that the context of this verse also says God will wipe out every tear from their eyes
Hyɛ no nsow sɛ saa nkyekyem yi ka nso sɛ Onyankopɔn bɛpopa wɔn aniwam nusu nyinaa
This is significant since tears are vital
Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛhwehwɛ mu efisɛ nusu ho hia
They serve to protect us as does the sense of pain
Ɛbɔ yɛn ho ban sɛnea ɛyaw a yetumi te no yɛ no ara pɛ
Tears keep our eyes moist and prevent friction between the eye and the lid
Nusu fɔw yɛn aniwa kesua na ɛmma yɛn aniwa kesua ne yɛn ani akyi hono ntwiw ho
They also wash foreign substances from our eyes
Eyi yɛn aniwa so fi nso
In addition they contain an antiseptic called lysozyme which disinfects the eyes and prevents infection
Afei nso aduru bi a wɔfrɛ no lysozyme wom a ɛbɔ yɛn aniwa no ho ban fi nyarewa ho
The ability to shed tears is thus a remarkable feature of our wonderfully designed bodies as is our sense of pain
Psalm

Even Jesus gave way to tears at the death of a friend

God did not originally purpose for people to shed such tears of sorrow

The sin of the first man Adam is responsible for the imperfect dying condition of the human family

Efforts to Understand Pain	Mmɔden a Wɔbɔ sɛ Wɔbɛte Ɛyaw Ase
Pain is still not fully understood

The eternal allure of trying to puzzle out what pain is said American Health magazine has scientists working intensely
American Health nsɛmma nhoma kae sɛ Hia a ɛho hia nyansahufo sɛ wobehu ɛyaw mu nti wɔkɔ so hwehwɛ mu denneennen
A few decades ago they assumed that pain was a form of sensation like sight hearing and touch that is felt by special nerve endings in the skin and is transmitted through particular nerve fibers to the brain
Mfe kakra a atwam no na wosusuw sɛ ɛyaw yɛ nkate bi te sɛ adehwɛ nnyigyei a wotumi te ne ade mu sɔ a wɔnam ehon ntini nketenkete soronko bi a ɛwɔ were no mu so na ɛte na ɛde fa ehon ntini nketewaa pɔtee bi mu kɔ amemene no mu
But this simplistic concept of pain was found to be untrue
Nanso wobehui sɛ saa ɛyaw ho nhwehwɛmu a wɔanyɛ no yiye yi nyɛ nokware
How ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so ?
One factor that led to the new insight was the study of a young woman who had no sense of pain
Ade biako a ɛmaa wonyaa nhumu foforo ne ababaa bi a na ɔnte ɛyaw ho ade a wosuae
Following her death in an examination of her brain and nervous system led to a whole new concept of the cause of pain
Nhwehwɛmu a wɔyɛe wɔ n’amemene ne ne nipadua mu tumi a ɔde te ade nka ho bere a owui wɔ mu no na ɛde ade a ɛde ɛyaw ba ho adwene foforo koraa bae
Doctors looked for the nerve endings explained The Star Weekly Magazine July
The Star Weekly Magazine July de no kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ dɔktafo hwehwɛɛ ehon ntini no anoano
If she didn t have any that would account for the girl s insensitivity
Sɛ na ababaa no nni bi a ɛnde ɛno nti na na ɔnte ɛyaw no
But they were present and apparently perfect
Nanso wohuu ehon ntini nketenkete no bi wɔ ne mu na na edi mu nso
Next the doctors examined the nerve fibers supposed to connect the nerve endings with the brain
Nea edi hɔ no dɔktafo no yɛɛ nhwehwɛmu wɔ ehon ntini nketenkete a ɛtoatoa ehon ntini akɛse no anoano de kɔ amemene no mu no mu
Here surely a defect would be found
Ɛha yi de na wɔwɔ ahotoso sɛ wobehu sintɔ bi
But it wasn t
Nanso amma saa
The fibers were all perfect as far as could be seen aside from those degenerated due to injury
Na ehon ntini nketenkete no nyinaa di mu sɛnea wobetumi ahu sɛ woyi nea esiane opira nti na atotɔ sin no to nkyɛn a
Finally examinations were made of the girl s brain and once more no defect of any kind could be established
Awiei koraa no wɔyɛɛ nhwehwɛmu wɔ ababaa no amemene mu na bio wɔanhu sintɔ biara
According to all existing knowledge and theory this girl should have felt pain normally yet she couldn t even feel tickling
Sɛnea nimdeɛ ne nkyerɛkyerɛ a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa kyerɛ no na anka ɛsɛ sɛ ababaa yi te ɛyaw nanso na ɔnte atiti mpo
She was however sensitive to pressure when applied to the skin and could distinguish between the touch of a pin head and a pin point although the pricking of the pin did not hurt

How Pain Sensations Are Modified	Sɛnea Wɔma Ɛyaw Nkate Sakra
In an attempt to explain some of the mystifying aspects of pain in a professor of psychology Ronald Melzack and a professor of anatomy Patrick Wall devised the widely acclaimed gate control theory of pain
Bere a wɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkyerɛkyerɛ ɛyaw ho nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu wɔ no adwene ho ɔbenfo Ronald Melzack ne akwaa ho nhwehwɛmu ho ɔbenfo Patrick Wall de ɛyaw ho nkyerɛkyerɛ a wogye tom kɛse a ɛne gate control ɛyaw kwan ano pon no bae
The edition of Dr
Bonica s textbook on pain said that this theory was among the most important developments in the field of pain research and therapy
Dɔkta Bonica nkyerɛkyerɛ nhoma a ɛfa ɛyaw ho de no kae sɛ nkyerɛkyerɛ yi ka ɛyaw ho nhwehwɛmu ne ano aduru ho nkɔso atitiriw a wɔanya no ho
According to the theory the opening and closing of a theoretical gate in the spinal cord either permits or blocks passage of pain signals to the brain
Sɛnea nkyerɛkyerɛ no kyerɛ no nsusuwii mu pon a ɛwɔ ehon ntini kɛse a ɛsa akyi berɛmo no mu no bue san to na ɛma ɛyaw ho sɛnkyerɛnne ahorow no kwan ma ɛkɔ amemene no mu anaasɛ esiw no kwan
If sensations other than pain crowd the gate then pain signals reaching the brain may be diminished
Sɛ nkate horow a ɛnyɛ ɛyaw de kɔkyere so wɔ ɔpon no ano a ɛnde ebia ɛyaw nsɛnkyerɛnne a edu amemene no mu no ano bɛbrɛ ase
Thus for example pain is lessened by rubbing or shaking a slightly burned finger since signals other than those of pain are thereby sent to the spinal cord to interfere with the passage of pain signals
Enti sɛ nhwɛso no sɛ biribi hyew obi nsateaa na sɛ ɔposaw anaa ɔwosow no kakra a ɛyaw no so tew efisɛ saa a ɔyɛ no ma nsɛnkyerɛnne horow a ɛnyɛ ɛyaw de fa ehon ntini kɛse no mu ma ɛkosiw ɛyaw nsɛnkyerɛnne no kwan
The discovery in that our bodies produce their own morphinelike substances called endorphins further helped in the search to understand the mystifying aspects of pain
Hu a wohui wɔ mu sɛ yɛn nipadua no tumi yɛ n’ankasa aduru bi a edwudwo ɛyaw ano a wɔfrɛ no endorphins no aboa bio wɔ ɛyaw ho nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ho nhwehwɛmu no mu
For instance some people may have little or no sensation of pain because they produce endorphins in excess
Sɛ nhwɛso no ebetumi aba sɛ nnipa binom nipadua tumi yɛ endorphins no mmoroso na ɛno nti na wɔte yaw ketewaa bi anaasɛ wɔnte bi koraa no
Endorphins may also explain the mystery of why pain is minimized or even eliminated by acupuncture a medical procedure in which hair thin needles are inserted into the body
Ebia endorphins no betumi ama yɛanya acupuncture ayaresa kwan bi a wɔnam mpaane nketenkete a wɔde wowɔw nipadua no a etumi tew ɛyaw so anaa etu ase koraa mpo a ɛyɛ nwonwa no mu ntease nso
According to eyewitness reports open heart surgery has been performed while the patient was awake alert and relaxed by utilizing acupuncture as the only painkiller !	Sɛnea obi a ɔde n’ani hui bɔɔ amanneɛ no acupuncture nkutoo na wɔde dii dwuma sɛ biribi a edwudwo ɛyaw ano bere a wɔyɛɛ obi oprehyɛn anikan so wɔ ne koma ho a na ɔnte yaw !
Why was no pain felt ?	Dɛn nti na wante ɛyaw biara ?
Some believe the needles may activate the production of endorphins that temporarily wipe out the pain
Ebinom gye di sɛ ebia mpaane no kanyan nipadua no ma etumi yɛ endorphins no pii ma esiw ɛyaw no ano bere tiaa mu
Another possibility is that acupuncture kills pain because the needles stimulate nerve fibers that send signals other than pain
Ɔkwan foforo a ɛnam so tumi ba saa nso ne sɛ acupuncture dwudwo ɛyaw no efisɛ mpaane no kanyan ehon ntini nketenkete no ma ɛde nkate afoforo a ɛnyɛ ɛyaw de kɔ amemene no mu
These signals crowd gates in the spinal cord preventing the pain signals from squeezing through to reach the brain where pain is sensed
Saa nsɛnkyerɛnne no kɔkyere so wɔ ehon ntini kɛse no mu pon no ano na esiw ɛyaw nsɛnkyerɛnne no kwan ma ennya kwan nkɔ amemene no mu baabi a edu a wɔte ɛyaw no
The gate control theory and the fact that the body produces its own painkillers may also explain why one s mood thoughts and emotions affect the measure of pain felt
Gate control nkyerɛkyerɛ no ne nokwasɛm a ɛyɛ sɛ nipadua no ankasa tumi yɛ n’aduru a edwudwo ɛyaw ano no nso betumi ama yɛate nea enti a obi adwene ne nsusuwii ne ne nkate ahorow tumi ka sɛnea ɔte ɛyaw no ase
Thus the shock of a sudden attack by a lion may have activated Livingstone s production of endorphins as well as flooded his spinal cord with signals other than those of pain
Enti ɛbɛyɛ sɛ gyata a ɔto hyɛɛ Livingstone so no ho hu kanyan ne nipadua ma ɛyɛɛ endorphins pii na saa ara na ɛmaa nsɛnkyerɛnne ahorow a ɛnyɛ ɛyaw de no kɔkyere so wɔ ehon ntini kɛse no pon no ano
His feelings of pain as a result were lessened
Ɛno nti na wante ɛyaw kɛse no
Yet as noted before one s frame of mind and emotions can have an opposite effect
Nanso sɛnea yɛadi kan ahu no obi adwene ne ne nkate betumi anya no so nkɛntɛnso bɔne
Too much of the everyday stress of typical modern life may increase a person s sensation of pain by producing anxiety tension and muscle contractions
Da biara da mu ɔhaw bebrebe a ɛwɔ ɛnnɛyi asetram no nam dadwen ɔhaw ne ntini a ɛtwetwe pua so betumi ama ɛyaw a obi te no mu ayɛ den
Happily though pain sufferers have reason for optimism

John Liebeskind a former president of the International Pain Foundation observed a few years ago I don t think there is a medical school in the world where more than four hours out of four years are spent teaching students to diagnose and treat pain problems

Breakthroughs in understanding pain however have coincided with greater efforts in treating it

Thus the outlook for pain sufferers has brightened

We can all be grateful American Health magazine reported that medicine now recognizes that chronic pain is no mere symptom but a treatable disease in itself

Linda Parsons the wife of a traveling overseer of Jehovah s Witnesses suffered from back pain for many years
Linda Parsons Yehowa Adansefo ɔhwɛfo kwantufo bi yere huu amane wɔ n’akyi berɛmo mu mfe pii
She sought help from one physician after another yet her pain continued unabated
Ɔhwehwɛɛ mmoa fii ayaresafo ahorow nkyɛn nanso ne yaw no kɔɔ so ara
One day in May last year in near desperation her husband picked up the phone book and looked under pain
Da koro bi wɔ afe a etwaam yi May mu bere a na ne kunu ho yeraw no no ɔfaa telefon nhoma hwehwɛɛ mu na ɔhwɛɛ ɛyaw ase
Listed was the phone number of a pain clinic not far from where they were serving in southern California
Ohuu ɛyaw ho ayaresabea bi a na ɛne baabi a wɔresom wɔ southern California hɔ ntam kwan nware telefon nɔma
An appointment was made and a few days later Linda met with a doctor to receive her initial consultation and evaluation
Wɔyɛɛ nsrahwɛ ho nhyehyɛe na nna kakraa bi akyi no Linda kohuu dɔkta bi maa ofii ase yɛɛ ne mu nhwehwɛmu
Arrangements were made to treat Linda as an outpatient
Wɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ wɔbɛsa Linda yare a wonnye no nto ayaresabea hɔ
She began visiting the clinic three times a week for treatment and also followed a treatment program at home
Ofii ase kɔɔ ayaresabea hɔ mpɛn abiɛsa dapɛn biara ma wɔhwɛɛ no na odii ofie ayaresa ho nhyehyɛe bi nso so
In a few weeks she began to feel marked improvement

Her husband explains I remember her saying almost in amazement one evening I can t believe that I hardly feel any pain

Within months regular visits to the clinic could be discontinued
Asram kakraa mu no na obetumi agyae ayaresabea hɔ a ɔkɔ no ntoatoaso no
The help Linda received to manage her pain is similar to that provided by many multidisciplinary pain clinics
Mmoa a Linda nya de dii ne yaw no ho dwuma no te sɛ nea ayaresabea ahorow a wɔsa ɛyaw no pii de ma no ara pɛ
Such a clinic employs the expertise of a team of health professionals which according to Dr
Bonica is the best approach to dealing with chronic pain

How Pain May Be Treated	Sɛnea Wobetumi Asa Ɛyaw
A clinic brochure describes the procedure on arrival Each individual is evaluated by a physician to assess the basis for the pain and then realistic goals and treatment programs are outlined

Specialized techniques and approaches are used to aid the body in releasing endorphins naturally produced chemicals in the body to diminish pain and anxiety and avoid drug dependence

Among the treatments Linda received were acupuncture and TENS which stands for transcutaneous across the skin electrical nerve stimulation
Acupuncture ne TENS a egyina hɔ ma transcutaneous were mu electrical nerve stimulation anyinam ahoɔden a wɔde kanyan nipadua mu ntini ka ayaresa a wɔde maa Linda no ho
She received electrical stimulation treatments at the clinic and was provided a small TENS unit to use at home
Wɔde anyinam ahoɔden kanyanee ne nipadua mu ntini wɔ ayaresabea hɔ na wɔmaa no TENS no ketewaa bi a ɔde bedi dwuma wɔ fie
Biofeedback a procedure in which the patient is taught to monitor his body responses and modify them to reduce the impact of pain was also employed

Physical therapy including deep tissue massage was a feature of the treatment regimen
Na honam mu ayaresa a nea ɛka ho ne nipadua no a womiamia ka ɛyaw ho ayaresa nhyehyɛe no ho
In time but only after Linda was ready for it an exercise program in the clinic s gymnasium was introduced and it became an essential part of treatment

Exercise is vital since it has been found to restore endorphins depleted by chronic pain
Apɔwmu teɛteɛ ho hia efisɛ wɔahu sɛ ɛma endorphins a ɛyaw a ennyae ma ɛso tew no san dɔɔso bio
The challenge however is to help people in pain to manage a beneficial exercise program
Nanso asɛnnennen no ne sɛnea wɔbɛboa nnipa a wɔte ɛyaw no ma wɔatumi adi apɔwmu teɛteɛ a mfaso wɔ so ho nhyehyɛe no so
Many chronic pain sufferers coming to clinics are taking large amounts of pain medication and Linda was no exception

But soon she had been weaned from her medication which is an important goal of pain clinics

Linda experienced no withdrawal symptoms yet that is not unusual

Pain expert Dr
Ronald Melzack noted that in a survey of more than burn victims
not a single case of later addiction could be attributed to the narcotics given for pain relief during the hospital stay

Since there is often a major psychological aspect to chronic pain clinics try to help patients in effect to unlearn their pain
Esiane sɛ ɛtaa ba sɛ ɛyaw a ennyae fi adwennwen titiriw nti a ayaresabea ahorow bɔ mmɔden boa ayarefo no ma wɔn werɛ fi ɛyaw no
What you think about explained Dr
Arthur Barsky a professor at Harvard Medical School what you expect how much attention you pay to feelings all these things have a tremendous influence on what you in fact feel

Are these new pain clinics the answer to mankind s pain problems ?	So saa ɛyaw ho ayaresabea afoforo yi ne adesamma yaw ho nsɛnnennen no ano aduru ?
Though the pain treatment methods described here can be helpful one must use care in choosing a competent clinic or pain specialist

Even then expectations must be realistic
Ɛno mpo ɛsɛ sɛ wohwɛ nneɛma pɔtee bi kwan
To illustrate with a typical success story Stephen Kaufman a former Olympic weight lifter was left almost an invalid because of chronic pain suffered when a mugger shot him in the neck

After eight months in a pain treatment program he was able to return to work full time and eventually even to competitive weight lifting
Bere a odii ayaresa nhyehyɛe bi so asram awotwe akyi no otumi kɔɔ adwuma bio na awiei koraa no ɔsan de ne ho kɔhyɛɛ nneɛma so mema akansi no mu mpo
Yet he said Half the time my toes burn like they re in boiling water
Nanso ɔkae sɛ Mpɛn pii no me nansoaa mu hyehye me te sɛ nea esisi nsu a ɛrehuru mu
So despite all the exciting progress it is obviously beyond human capability to fulfill the Bible s promise Pain will be no more

Life Without Pain At Hand !	Asetra A Ɛyaw Nnim Abɛn !
THE body s complex mechanisms that protect us from harm are certainly a marvel
NIPADUA no mu nneɛma horow a emu dɔ a ɛbɔ yɛn ho ban fi ɔhaw ho no yɛ nwonwa ankasa
A study of them should move us to praise the Creator as did the Bible psalmist who wrote I shall laud you because in a fear inspiring way I am wonderfully made
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛho ade a yesua no ka yɛn ma yeyi Ɔbɔadeɛ no ayɛ sɛnea Bible mu odwontofo a ɔkyerɛwee nea edi so yi yɛe no Meda wo ase sɛ woyɛɛ me ma ɛyɛ hu ne nwonwa
Truly only God can make possible life without pain !	Nokwarem no Onyankopɔn nkutoo na obetumi de asetra a ɛyaw nnim aba !
But how will this be accomplished ?	Nanso ɔkwan bɛn so na wobedi eyi ho dwuma ?
Note that just prior to the promise about pain and tears being eliminated the Bible tells of a new heaven and a new earth for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away
Hyɛ no nso sɛ ansa na Bible no rehyɛ bɔ sɛ ɛyaw ne nusu befi hɔ no na aka ɔsoro foforo ne asase foforo ne kan soro ne kan asase a ebetwam ’ ho asɛm
Of course the Bible is not speaking of our literal heaven and earth passing away
Nokwarem no ɛnyɛ ɔsoro ne asase paa yi na Bible no ka ho asɛm sɛ ebetwam no
Rather it is saying in short that a completely new system of things will replace this present one
Na mmom ne tiaatwa mu no ɛne sɛ nhyehyɛe foforo koraa bɛba abesi mprempren nhyehyɛe yi ananmu
Yes a new superhuman government will make it possible to enjoy a painless life right here on earth
Yiw nniso foforo a ɛkorɔn sen nnipa de bɛma ayɛ yiye sɛ yebenya asetra a ɛyaw nnim wɔ asase so ha
In describing this government the Bible says that the God of heaven will set up a kingdom or government that will
crush and put an end to all these kingdoms and it itself will stand to times indefinite
Ɛreka saa nniso yi ho asɛm no Bible no ka sɛ ɔsoro Nyankopɔn bɛma ahenni anaasɛ nniso a wɔrensɛe no da

Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven

How though can the fulfillment of that prayer mean a life without pain for you ?	Ɛnde ɔkwan bɛn so na saa mpae no mmamu bɛkyerɛ asetra a ɛyaw nnim ama wo ?
A Ruler With Superhuman Power	Sodifo a Ne Tumi Korɔn Sen Nnipa De
The key lies in the wisdom and power of the one whom God has chosen to head His government
Onii a Onyankopɔn apaw no sɛ ɔnyɛ Ne nniso no so panyin no nyansa ne ne tumi so na asɛm no gyina
That one is Jesus Christ himself
Saa nipa no ne Yesu Kristo ankasa
Of him a Bible prophecy says The government shall be upon his shoulder
Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end
Isaiah KJ
Bible nkɔmhyɛ bi ka ne ho asɛm sɛ Ahenni no bɛda ne mmati so na n’ahenni mu bɛtrɛw na asomdwoe a enni awiei aba
’ Yesaia
The wisdom of Jesus now in heaven is far greater than that of all earthly physicians
Yesu a ɔwɔ soro mprempren no nyansa sen asase so nnuruyɛfo nyinaa koraa
He fully understands the workings of our physical body including its systems for protecting itself from injury
Ɔte sɛnea yɛn nipadua yi yɛ adwuma no ase koraa a nhyehyɛe a ɛnam so bɔ ne ho ban fi opira ho ka ho
When he was a man on earth over years ago there was not a disease or affliction that he could not cure
Bere a na ɔwɔ asase so sɛ onipa bɛboro mfe atwam ni no yare anaa ɔhaw biara nni hɔ a wantumi ansa
He thus demonstrated what he will do on a larger scale as Ruler of God s Kingdom
Enti ɔnam saayɛ so daa nea ɔbɛyɛ no kɛse sɛ Onyankopɔn Ahenni no so Hene no adi
Of one instance the Bible says 	Bible no ka bere bi ho asɛm sɛ 
 Then great crowds approached him having along with them people that were lame maimed blind dumb and many otherwise and they fairly threw them at his feet and he cured them so that the crowd felt amazement as they saw the dumb speaking and the lame walking and the blind seeing
Nkurɔfo akuwakuw pii de mpakye mmubuafo anifuraefo mum ne afoforo pii baa ne nkyɛn na wɔde wɔn beguu ne nan ase

Among the afflictions that Jesus will cure during his Kingdom rule is that dreadful one chronic pain
Nea ɛka nyarewa a Yesu bɛsa wɔ n’Ahenni nniso no mu ho ne nea ɛyɛ hu no ɛyaw a ennyae
Indeed what a marvelous blessing that will be !	Nokwarem no nhyira a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn na ɛno bɛyɛ !
And it will not be accomplished in behalf of just a few
Na wɔrenyɛ eyi mma nnipa kakraa bi pɛ
The Creator s promise is No resident will say I am sick
Ɔbɔadeɛ no bɔhyɛ ne sɛ Ɔmanfo no mu bi renka sɛ Magurow ! 
Then under the rule of God s Kingdom the promise will be fulfilled neither will
pain be anymore

I Found True Wealth in Australia	Minyaa Nokware Ahonyade wɔ Australia
IT WAS April
NA ƐYƐ April
After spending seven years in Australia I had recently returned to Greece to visit my family
Na masan aba Greece foforo rebɛsra m’abusua bere a makodi mfe ason wɔ Australia no
It was evening and I was sitting quietly at a cafe table in the village square of Karies when the local priest and the mayor came and sat opposite me
Na ɛyɛ anwummere na na mete didipon ho komm wɔ akuraa bi a wɔfrɛ no Karies abɔnten so adidibea bi bere a ɛhɔ sɔfo ne kurow no sohwɛfo bae bɛtraa ase ne me dii nhwɛanim
It was obvious they were eager to pick a quarrel
Na ɛda adi pefee sɛ wɔpɛ sɛ wɔne me ham
With scarcely a greeting the priest charged that I had migrated to Australia only for the purpose of making money
Bere a wɔankyia me mpo no ɔsɔfo no bɔɔ me sobo sɛ sikapɛ ara nti na mituu kwan kɔɔ Australia
To say that I was taken aback would put it mildly
Sɛ meka sɛ me ho annwiriw me a na meboa
I replied as calmly as possible that while I was living in Australia I was able to acquire wealth far more valuable than money
Miyii ano brɛoo sɛnea metumi sɛ bere a na mete Australia no mitumi nyaa agyapade a ɛsom bo koraa sen sika
My answer surprised him but he then demanded to know just what I meant
Me mmuae no maa ne ho dwiriw no nanso ɔpɛe sɛ ohu nea na mekyerɛ no
I replied that among other things I had learned that God has a name
Mibuae sɛ nneɛma a masua no mu biako ne Onyankopɔn din
And this is something you neglected to teach me I said looking him straight in the eye
Mehwɛɛ n’anim ka kyerɛɛ no pen sɛ Na eyi ne ade a wubuu w’ani guu so sɛ wobɛkyerɛ me
Before he could retaliate I asked Would you please tell me the name of God that Jesus referred to when he taught us to pray in the model prayer Let your name be sanctified ? Matthew

Word about the dispute spread quickly in the village square and within ten minutes some people had gathered
Anobaabae no ho asɛm trɛw kɔɔ akuraa no abɔnten so ntɛmntɛm na simma du pɛ mu no na nnipa bɛyɛ atwa ahyia hɔ
The priest started to feel uncomfortable
Ɔsɔfo no ho fii ase yeraw no
He would not answer my question about God s name and he had weak answers to further Bible questions
Wanyi m’asemmisa a ɛfa Onyankopɔn din ho no ano na wantumi amma mmuae papa biara wɔ Bible nsemmisa foforo a mibisabisaa no no hɔ

when an intoxicated man began shouting angrily

At that I suggested to the crowd that in view of the late hour we should all go home

I was born in the village of Karies in Peloponnisos in December

We were extremely poor and when I wasn t attending school I was working alongside Mother from sunrise to sunset in the rice fields standing knee deep in water

For me to receive training as a plumber and window installer my parents gave my employer pounds kg of wheat and pounds kg of vegetable oil which was almost their entire income for a year

At times I considered returning home but I could not do that to my parents

They had made such an unselfish sacrifice in my behalf

Afei misii gyinae sɛ mɛkɔ Athens a ɛyɛ ɔman no ahenkuro baabi a na adwuma hwehwɛ nyɛ den
There I found employment and rented a room
Minyaa adwuma wɔ hɔ na megyee ɔdan bi tuaa ho ka
Each day after work I returned home cooked for myself cleaned up the room and then spent what little free time I had learning English German and Italian
Sɛ mepɔn adwuma daa a na meba fie bɛnoa m’aduan siesie ɔdan no mu na afei mede bere kakra a mewɔ no sua Engiresi German ne Italian kasa
The immoral talk and behavior of other youths troubled me so I avoided their association
Ɔbrasɛe ho nkɔmmɔ a na mmofra foforo bɔ ne wɔn nneyɛe no haw me enti mekwatii wɔn fekubɔ
But this caused me to feel quite alone
Nanso eyi maa metee ankonamyɛ nka
When I turned I was required to perform military service during which time I continued my study of languages
Bere a midii mfe no wɔhwehwɛe sɛ mikosua asraadi na mekɔɔ so suaa kasa horow no
Then in March after I left the army I migrated to Australia settling in Melbourne

Several years later in an elderly lady one of Jehovah s Witnesses called at our house and offered The Watchtower and Awake !	Mfe pii akyi wɔ mu no ɔbea bi a ne mfe akɔ anim a ɔyɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako baa yɛn fie bɛmaa yɛn Ɔwɛn Aban ne Nyan !
I found the magazines interesting so I put them in a safe place instructing my wife not to throw them away
M’ani gyee nsɛmma nhoma no ho enti mede siei ka kyerɛɛ me yere sɛ ɔnnto nngu
A year later two other Witnesses called and offered me a free home Bible study
Afe akyi Adansefo baanu foforo bae ne me bɛyɛɛ ofie Bible adesua a wontua hwee ho nhyehyɛe
I accepted and what I learned from the Scriptures was just what I had been looking for to fill the emptiness that had existed in my life
Mepenee so na nea misua fii Kyerɛwnsɛm no mu ne nea na merehwehwɛ ma adi nka a na mete sɛ m’asetra yɛ hunu no ho dwuma
As soon as my neighbor found out that I was studying with the Witnesses she referred me to the Evangelists claiming that they were a better religion
Bere a me fipamfo hui sɛ mene Adansefo no resua ade pɛ na ɔkyerɛɛ me Evangelistfo sɛ wɔn asɔre no na eye
As a result I also began studying with an elder from the Evangelist Church
Ɛno nti me ne Evangelist Asɔre no panyin nso suaa ade
Soon I began attending meetings of both the Evangelists and the Witnesses for I was determined to find the true religion
Ankyɛ na mifii ase kɔɔ Evangelistfo ne Adansefo no nhyiam horow efisɛ na masi me bo sɛ mɛhwehwɛ nokware som
At the same time in fairness to my Greek upbringing I began looking more deeply into the Orthodox religion
Saa bere no ara esiane sɛ wɔtetee me sɛ Greeceni nti mifii ase hwehwɛɛ Ortodɔks som no mu kɔɔ akyiri
One day I went to three Greek Orthodox churches
Da bi mekɔɔ Greecefo Ortodɔks asɔre ahorow abiɛsa mu
When I explained the purpose of my visit at the first one the priest slowly showed me to the door
Bere a mekyerɛkyerɛɛ me nsrahwɛ no atirimpɔw mu wɔ asɔre a edi kan no mu no ɔsɔfo no kyerɛɛ me ɔpon no ano kwan brɛoo sɛ mimfi adi
As he did he explained that we were Greek and so it was wrong to associate with either the Witnesses or the Evangelists
Bere a ɔyɛɛ saa no ɔkyerɛkyerɛɛ mu kyerɛɛ me sɛ yɛyɛ Asɔre a agye ntini wɔ Greece no mufo na enti ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ mede me ho bɛbɔ Adansefo anaa Evangelistfo no
His attitude surprised me but I thought Maybe this particular priest is not a good representative of the church
Ne nneyɛe no maa me ho dwiriw me nanso misusuwii sɛ Ebia na saa sɔfo yi ankasa na ɔnyɛ asɔre no nanmusifo papa
’
To my surprise the priest at the second church reacted similarly
Nea ɛyɛɛ me nwonwa no ɔsɔfo a ɔwɔ asɔre a ɛto so abien no mu no nso yɛɛ saa ara
He did tell me however that there was a Bible study class conducted by a theologian at his church every Saturday evening
Nanso ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ nyamekyerɛfo bi yɛ Bible adesua wɔ n’asɔre no mu Memeneda anwummere biara
When I tried the third church I was further disillusioned
Mekɔɔ asɔre a ɛto so abiɛsa mu kɔyɛɛ nhwehwɛmu na m’abam bui
However I decided to attend the Bible study class conducted at the second church visiting there the next Saturday
Nanso misii gyinae sɛ mɛkɔ Bible adesua a wɔyɛ wɔ asɔre a ɛto so abien no mu no bi na mekɔɔ hɔ Memeneda a edi hɔ no
I enjoyed following the reading from the Bible book of Acts
M’ani gyee Bible mu nhoma a ɛne Asomafo no Nnwuma a wɔkenkan ma midii akyi no ho
When the portion about Cornelius kneeling before Peter was read the theologian interrupted the reading and pointed out that Peter had correctly refused Cornelius act of worship
Bere a wɔkenkanee ɔfa a ɛfa sɛnea Kornelio kotow Petro anim no nyamekyerɛni no ma yegyaee akenkan na ɔkaee sɛ Petro yɛɛ no yiye sɛ ɔpow Kornelio ɔsom adeyɛ no
At that I raised my hand and said that I had a question
Ɛhɔ no memaa me nsa so kae sɛ mewɔ asemmisa
Yes what is it you want to know ? 	 Aha dɛn na wopɛ sɛ wuhu ? 
 Well if the apostle Peter refused to be worshiped why do we have his icon and worship it ? 	 Wiɛ sɛ ɔsomafo Petro powee sɛ ɔbɛma wɔasom no a dɛn nti na yɛwɔ n’ahoni na yɛsom no ? 
There was dead silence for several seconds
Ɛhɔ yɛɛ dinn anibu pii mu
Then it was as if a bomb had dropped
Afei ɛyɛɛ sɛnea wɔato ɔtopae bi
Tempers flared and there were cries of Where did you come from ? 	Ne bo fuwii na ɔteɛteɛɛm sɛ Ehe na wufi ? 
For two hours there was heated debate with a lot of shouting
Yɛgyee akyinnye denneennen nnɔnhwerew abien a na nteɛteɛm pii ka ho
Finally as I was leaving I was handed a book to take home
Awiei koraa no merefi hɔ no wɔmaa me nhoma bi sɛ memfa nkɔ fie
When I opened it the first words I read were We are Greek and our religion has shed blood in order to preserve our tradition
Bere a mibuee mu no nsɛm a edi kan a mekanee ne sɛ Yɛyɛ Greecefo yɛn som no ahwie mogya agu sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a yɛbɛkora yɛn atetesɛm so
I knew that God does not belong only to the Greek people so I immediately severed ties with the Greek Orthodox Church
Na minim sɛ Onyankopɔn nni hɔ mma Greecefo nkutoo enti migyaee Greecefo Ortodɔks Asɔre no ntɛm ara
From then on I continued my Bible study only with the Witnesses
Efi saa bere no me ne Adansefo no nkutoo na ɛkɔɔ so yɛɛ Bible adesua
In April I symbolized my dedication to Jehovah by water baptism and my wife was baptized six months later
Mede nsu mu asubɔ yɛɛ m’ahosohyira ma Yehowa no ho sɛnkyerɛnne wɔ April mu na wɔbɔɔ me yere asu asram asia akyi
Contact With the Village Priest	Me ne Akuraa Sɔfo Nkitahodi
Toward the end of that year the priest from my home village in Greece sent a letter requesting money to help repair the village church
Ɛde rekɔ saa afe no awiei no m’akuraa a ɛwɔ Greece no sɔfo kyerɛw me krataa a na ɔrebisa me sika de asiesie akuraa no asɔredan
Instead of sending money I sent him the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life along with a letter explaining that I was now one of Jehovah s Witnesses and that I believed I had found the truth
Sɛ anka mede sika bɛmena no no mede nhoma Nokware a Ɛde Kɔ Daa Nkwa Mu kaa krataa a mede kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ meyɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako na afei na migye di sɛ mahu nokware no ho
Upon receiving my letter he announced in church that an immigrant to Australia had rebelled
Bere a ne nsa kaa me krataa no ɔkaa no asɔredan mu sɛ obi a watu akɔtra Australia atew atua
Afterward the mothers who had sons in Australia kept asking the priest whether it was their son
Ɛno akyi no ɛnanom a wɔn mmabarima atu akɔtra Australia kɔɔ so bisaa ɔsɔfo no sɛ ebia ɛyɛ wɔn babarima anaa
My mother even went to his house and begged him to tell her
Me maame kɔɔ ne fie mpo kɔsrɛɛ no sɛ ɔnka nkyerɛ no
Unfortunately it is your son he said
Ɔkae sɛ Ɛyɛ yaw ɛyɛ wo babarima no
Later Mother told me that she would have preferred he had killed her than tell her this about me
Akyiri yi Maame ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ okum no a anka ɔpɛ sen sɛ ɔkaa me ho asɛm a ɛte saa kyerɛɛ no
Return to Greece	Mesan Kɔ Greece
After our baptism my wife and I wanted to return to Greece and tell our families and friends of the good things we had learned from the Bible
Wɔ yɛn asubɔ akyi no me ne me yere pɛe sɛ yɛsan kɔ Greece na yɛkɔka nneɛma pa a yɛasua afi Bible mu no kyerɛ yɛn mmusua ne nnamfonom
So in April accompanied by our five year old daughter Dimitria we returned for an extended vacation staying in the town of Kiparissia about miles km from my home village of Karies
Enti wɔ April mu yɛne yɛn babea a na wadi mfe anum Dimitria san kodii akwamma a ɛware na yɛtraa Kiparissia a efi m’akuraa Karies kɔ hɔ yɛ kilomita no mu
Our round trip airline tickets were good for a six month stay
Na yɛn tekit a yebɛsan de aforo wimhyɛn akɔ Australia no yɛ nea edi mu wɔ asram asia a yedii no
On the second night home Mother broke down and told me tearfully that I had taken the wrong course and had disgraced the family name
Da a ɛto so abien anadwo no Maame fii ase sui na ɔde nusu ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ mafa ɔkwammɔne so na magu abusua no din ho fi
Crying and sobbing she implored me to turn from my erroneous course
Ɔde nusu paa me kyɛw sɛ mensan mfi me kwammɔne no so
Then she fainted and collapsed in my arms
Afei ade tɔɔ ne so wɔ me nsam
The next day I tried to reason with her explaining that I had simply increased my knowledge of the God about whom she had so lovingly taught us from infancy
Da a edi hɔ no mebɔɔ mmɔden sɛ me ne no besusuw nsɛm ho na mekyerɛkyerɛɛ no mu sɛ ɛyɛ Onyankopɔn a ofi ɔdɔ mu akyerɛkyerɛ yɛn ne ho ade fi yɛn mmofraase no ho nimdeɛ a ɛkɔ akyiri na manya
The following evening I had that memorable encounter with the local priest and the village mayor
Da a edi hɔ anwummere no na me ne akuraa hɔ sɔfo ne ɛsohwɛfo no dii anobaabae a me werɛ mfi da no
My two younger brothers who lived in Athens had come to stay for Easter
Na me nuabarimanom nkumaa baanu a wɔte Athens no aba yɛn kurom rebedi Easter
They both avoided me as if I were a leper
Wɔn baanu twee wɔn ho fii me ho te sɛ nea meyare kwata
One day however the older of the two began to listen
Nanso da bi baanu no mu panyin fii ase tiee me
After several hours of discussion he said that he agreed with everything I had shown him from the Bible
Bere a yɛde nnɔnhwerew pii bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ no ɔkae sɛ ogye biribiara a mafi Bible mu akyerɛ no no di
From that day on he defended me before the rest of the family
Efi saa da no rekɔ no ogyinaa m’akyi kyerɛkyerɛɛ nsɛm mu wɔ abusuafo nkae no anim
Afterward I visited Athens often to stay with my brother
Ɛno akyi no na metaa kɔ Athens kɔtra me nuabarima no nkyɛn
Each time I did he invited other families to come and hear the good news
Sɛ mekɔ hɔ bere biara a na ɔto nsa frɛ mmusua afoforo ma wobetie asɛmpa no
To my great joy he and his wife along with three other families with whom they conducted Bible studies later symbolized their dedication to God by water baptism !	Nea ɛyɛ me anigye ne sɛ ɔne ne yere ne mmusua afoforo abiɛsa a wɔne wɔn yɛɛ Bible adesua no de nsu mu asubɔ yɛɛ wɔn ho so a wɔahyira ama Onyankopɔn no ho sɛnkyerɛnne !
The weeks passed quickly and just before our six months was up a Witness serving in a congregation about miles km from our village visited
Adapɛn no twaam ntɛmntɛm na aka kakraa ma yɛn asram asia no aso no Ɔdansefo bi a ɔresom wɔ asafo a efi yɛn akuraa rekɔ hɔ yɛ kilomita bɛsraa yɛn
He pointed to the help needed with the preaching work in the area and asked whether I had given thought to staying permanently
Ɔkaa mmoa a ɛho hia wɔ asɛmpaka adwuma no mu wɔ mpɔtam hɔ no ho asɛm na obisae sɛ ebia masusuw ɛhɔ a mɛtra no ho a
That night I discussed the possibility with my wife
Me ne me yere bɔɔ tra a yɛbɛtra hɔ no ho nkɔmmɔ saa da no anadwo
It would be difficult to stay we both agreed
Yɛn baanu nyinaa gye toom sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ yɛbɛtra hɔ
But it was obvious that there was a great need for the people to hear Bible truth
Nanso na ɛda adi sɛ mmoa ho hia kɛse na nkurɔfo no ate Bible mu nokware no
Finally we decided to stay for a year or two at least
Awiei koraa no yesii gyinae sɛ yɛbɛtra hɔ anyɛ yiye koraa no afe anaa mfe abien
My wife would return to Australia to sell our house and car and bring back what belongings she could
Na me yere bɛsan akɔ Australia akɔtɔn yɛn fie ne yɛn kar na ɔde yɛn nneɛma a obetumi no aba
Having made our decision we went into town the next morning and rented a house

We also enrolled our daughter in the local primary school

Opposition Explodes	Ɔsɔretia Sɔre
Virtual war was soon declared on us
Ankyɛ na wɔko tiaa yɛn
Opposition came from the police the school principal and the teachers
Ɔsɔretia no fii polisifo sukuu sohwɛfo ne tikyafo nkyɛn na ɛbae
At school Dimitria would not make the sign of the cross
Wɔ sukuu no na Dimitria nyɛ mmeamudua sɛnkyerɛnne no
School officials called a policeman to try to frighten her into complying but she stood firm
Sukuu mpanyimfo frɛɛ polisini bi sɛ ommehunahuna no ma onni so nanso ogyinaa pintinn
I was called in to see the principal and he showed me a letter from the archbishop that ordered that I take Dimitria and leave
Sukuu sohwɛfo no too nsa frɛɛ me na ɔde krataa a efi ɔsɔfopanyin no hɔ a ɛhyɛ sɛ minyi Dimitria mfi sukuu no mu kyerɛɛ me
After my having a long discussion with the principal however she was permitted to remain in school
Nanso bere a me ne sukuu sohwɛfo no bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ bere tenteenten akyi no ɔpenee so ma ɔtraa hɔ
In time I learned that there was a couple in Kiparissia who had attended an assembly of Jehovah s Witnesses and we were able to renew their interest
Akyiri yi metee sɛ awarefo bi wɔ Kiparissia a wɔakɔ Yehowa Adansefo nhyiam na yetumi kanyan wɔn anigye bio
My wife and I also invited Witnesses from a nearby village to our home for Bible studies
Me ne me yere nso too nsa frɛɛ Adansefo a wɔwowɔ nkuraase a ɛbemmɛn hɔ baa yɛn fie ma yɛyɛɛ Bible adesua
Shortly however the police came and took us all down to the police station for questioning
Nanso ankyɛ na polisifo bae bɛfaa yɛn nyinaa kɔɔ polisi adwumam kobisabisaa yɛn nsɛm
I was charged with using my house as a place of worship without a license
Wɔbɔɔ me sobo sɛ mede me fie ayɛ baabi a wɔsom bere a minni tumi krataa
But since we were not imprisoned we continued our meetings
Nanso esiane sɛ wɔamfa yɛn anto afiase nti yɛkɔɔ so yɛɛ yɛn nhyiam horow no
Although I was offered a job as soon as the bishop heard about it he threatened to have my employer s shop closed unless he dismissed me
Wɔfaa me adwuma bi mu nanso bere a ɔsɔfopɔn no tee ho asɛm pɛ ohunahunaa m’adwumawura no sɛ ɔbɛma wɔato n’adwuma no mu kosi sɛ obeyi me adi
A plumbing sheet metal shop was for sale and we were able to buy it
Na wɔretɔn adwumayɛbea bi a wɔyɛ dorobɛn a nsu fa mu ne nkyɛnsee ho nneɛma na yetumi tɔe
Almost immediately two priests came with threats to close us down and a few weeks later the archbishop ordered that our family be excommunicated
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ amonom hɔ ara na asɔfo baanu baa hɔ behunahunaa yɛn sɛ wɔbɛto yɛn adwumayɛbea no mu na adapɛn kakraa akyi no ɔsɔfopanyin no hyɛe sɛ wonnyi yɛn abusuafo no mfi asɔre no mu
Anyone then excommunicated from the Greek Orthodox Church was treated as a total outcast
Saa bere no na wɔne obi a woyi no fi Greecefo Ortodɔks Asɔre no mu no di no te sɛ nea wɔapam no afi ɔman no mu koraa
A police officer was stationed outside our shop to deter anyone from coming in
Wɔde polisi panyin bi begyinaa yɛn adwumayɛbea no ano de pamoo obiara a ɔbɛba hɔ abɛtɔ ade
Even though there were no customers we doggedly kept the shop open every day

Our predicament soon became the talk of the town

One Saturday another person and I set out on his motorbike to witness in a nearby town
Memeneda bi me ne onipa foforo traa ne moto so sɛ yɛrekɔ adansedi wɔ kurow bi a ɛbɛn mu
There the police stopped us and took us down to the police station where we were kept in custody all weekend
Polisifo no gyinaa yɛn wɔ hɔ na wɔde yɛn kɔɔ wɔn adwumam baabi a wɔde yɛn too afiase dapɛn awiei no nyinaa
On Monday morning we were taken back to Kiparissia by train
Wɔde yɛn foroo keteke san kɔɔ Kiparissia Dwoda anɔpa
News that we had been arrested spread and a crowd gathered at the railway station to see us arrive with our police escorts
Yɛn kyere no ho asɛm trɛwee na nnipadɔm baa keteke gyinabea hɔ bɛhwɛɛ yɛn a polisifo akyere yɛn no
After being fingerprinted we were taken to the public prosecutor
Bere a wɔde yɛn nsa tintimii krataa so wiei no wɔde yɛn kɔɔ aban mmaranimfo hɔ sɛ wɔrekodi yɛn asɛm
He began proceedings by saying that he would read aloud accusations against us that had been compiled from villagers who had been questioned by the police
Ofii n’asɛm no ase denam ka a ɔkaa sɛ ɔbɛkenkan sobo ahorow a wɔabɔ yɛn a wonya fii nkuraasefo a polisifo kobisabisaa wɔn nsɛm no hɔ akyerɛ yɛn
They told us that Jesus Christ had become King in the year the first accusation said
Sobo a edi kan no ni Wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ Yesu Kristo adi Hene wɔ afe mu
Wherever did you get this strange idea ? the prosecutor asked belligerently
Aban mmaranimfo no bisaa no anuɔdenso so sɛ Ɛhe na munyaa adwen foforo yi ? 
I stepped forward and took the Bible he had on his desk and opened it to Matthew chapter and suggested that he read it
Mekɔɔ m’anim na mefaa Bible a ɛda ne pon so no buee Mateo ti maa no sɛ ɔnkenkan
He hesitated for a moment but then took the Bible and began to read
Ɔtwentwɛn ne nan ase kakra na afei ɔfaa Bible no kenkanee
After reading a few minutes he said excitedly Hey if this is true then I should drop everything and join a monastery ! 	Ɔkenkan simma kakraa no ɔde anigye kae sɛ Ei sɛ eyi yɛ nokware a ɛnde ɛsɛ sɛ migyae biribiara na mede me ho kɔhyɛ nkokora som bi mu ! 
 No I said quietly
You should learn the truth of the Bible and then help others to find the truth as well
Mekaa no brɛoo sɛ Dabi ɛsɛ sɛ wusua Bible mu nokware no na woboa afoforo nso ma wohu nokware no
A few lawyers arrived and we were also able to witness to some of them during the day
Mmaranimfo kakraa baa hɔ na yetumi dii wɔn mu binom adanse ɛda no
Ironically this resulted in another charge proselytizing !	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no eyi nso bɛdanee asɛm foforo sɛ yɛsakra nkurɔfo !
During that year we had three court cases but finally we were acquitted of all charges
Saa afe no mu no wɔde yɛn kɔɔ asennibea mprɛnsa nanso awiei koraa no wotwaa nsɛm a wɔka too yɛn so no nyinaa mu
The victory seemed to break the ice as far as the people s attitude toward us was concerned
Ɛyɛɛ te sɛ nea nkonim a yedii no yii adwemmɔne a nkurɔfo wɔ wɔ yɛn ho no afi hɔ
From then on they began to approach us more freely and listen to what we had to say about God s Kingdom
Efi saa bere no wofii ase fii wɔn pɛ mu baa yɛn nkyɛn betiee Onyankopɔn Ahenni ho asɛm a yɛka no
Eventually the small study group in our home in Kiparissia was formed into a congregation
Awiei koraa no adesua kuw ketewaa a ɛwɔ yɛn fie wɔ Kiparissia no bɛyɛɛ asafo
A Christian elder was transferred to our new congregation and I was appointed a ministerial servant

The meetings in our house were soon being attended regularly by active Witnesses

The horoscope is a diagram of the relative positions of planets and signs of the zodiac at a specific time as at one s birth and is used by astrologers to try to foretell future events in a person s life

THE practice of watching the stars is not new
NSOROMMA a wɔhwɛ nyɛ ade foforo
According to The World Book Encyclopedia farmers thousands of years ago watched the stars to know when to plant their crops
Sɛnea The World Book Encyclopedia kyerɛ no akuafo a wɔtraa ase mfe mpempem pii a atwam no hwɛɛ nsoromma de huu bere a ɛfata sɛ wodua wɔn nnɔbae
Travelers learned to use the stars to tell directions

Even today in space travel stars are still used as guides
Wɔda so ara de nsoromma di dwuma sɛ ade a ɛkyerɛ kwan wɔ ahunmu akwantu mu nnɛ mpo
Ancients also invented myths of persons and animals that they felt were pictured in groups of stars or constellations

A Vast Choice of Stars	Nsoromma Ahorow Pii
The sheer number of and size of the stars inspire awe
Nsoromma dodow ne n’akɛse nko ara tumi kanyan ehu
It is estimated that there are some billion galaxies or huge groupings of stars in the universe !	Wobu akontaa sɛ nsoromma akuw anaa nsoromma akuw akɛse bɛyɛ ɔpepepem na ɛwɔ amansan yi mu !
The International Encyclopedia of Astronomy says That is the number of grains of rice that could be packed into an average cathedral
The International Encyclopedia of Astronomy ka sɛ Ɛno bɛyɛ sɛ ɛmo aba mfuamfua a wobetumi aboa ano agu asɔredan kɛse bi mu
The Milky Way galaxy of which our solar system is a part is estimated to have at least that many stars

The star nearest our Earth other than the Sun one of the Alpha Centauri group is about
light years away
Nsoromma a ɛbɛn yɛn Asase pɛɛ sɛ yeyi Owia to nkyɛn a ne nsoromma akuw a wɔfrɛ no Alpha Centauri no mu biako no ntam kwan bɛyɛ sɛ hann mfe
A light year is the distance light travels in one year
Hann afe yɛ kwan tenten a hann twa wɔ afe biako mu
That means that when we look at that star the light entering our eye left the star
years earlier and during all that time was traveling through space at a velocity of miles a second km sec

No wonder God s prophet declared Look ! The nations are as a drop from a bucket and as the film of dust on the scales they have been accounted
Look !	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ Onyankopɔn diyifo bi kae sɛ Hwɛ amanaman te sɛ bokiti ho nsukoko a ɛresosɔ na wobu wɔn sɛ nsenia mu mfutumawa bi

The closest heavenly body to earth is the moon which exercises a definite influence on our earth its gravity even causing a difference of over feet meters between high and low tides in some places

But first what do ancient sources such as the Bible tell us about the stars ?	Nanso nea edi kan no dɛn na tete nhoma ahorow te sɛ Bible no ka wɔ nsoromma no ho kyerɛ yɛn ?
Stars in the Scriptures	Nsoromma ho Nsɛm a Ɛwɔ Kyerɛwnsɛm no Mu
The Bible makes many references to stars both in a literal and in a figurative sense
Bible no ka nsoromma ankasa ne sɛnkyerɛnne kwan so de ho nsɛm pii nso
For instance according to one psalmist the Creator made the moon and the stars to dominate the night so that the stars would help furnish light for the earth
Sɛ nhwɛso no sɛnea odwontofo bi kae no Ɔbɔadeɛ no yɛɛ ɔsram ne nsoromma sɛ enni anadwo so sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a nsoromma no bɛboa ma hann aba asase no so
Later when making a covenant with faithful Abraham God said Look up please to the heavens and count the stars if you are possibly able to count them
Akyiri yi bere a Onyankopɔn ne Abraham reyɛ apam no Ɔkae sɛ Hwɛ ɔsoro ɛ na kan nsoromma sɛ wubetumi akan anaa ?
And he went on to say to him So your seed will become
Na ɔka kyerɛɛ no sɛ Sɛ w’asefo bɛyɛ nen
The apostle Paul points out that stars have differences saying The glory of the sun is one sort and the glory of the moon is another and the glory of the stars is another in fact star differs from star in glory
Ɔsomafo Paulo daa no adi sɛ nsoromma gu ahorow bere a ɔkae sɛ Owia anuonyam nko ɔsram anuonyam nko nsoromma anuonyam nko na ɛsonsono nsoromma mmiako mmiako anuonyam
At the same time this vast number of stars and their glory are not outside the realm or the control of their Creator He is counting the number of the stars all of them he calls by their names
Psalm
Bere koro no ara no saa nsoromma huhaa no ne wɔn anuonyam mpa Nea Ɔbɔe no ani so anaasɛ ɛnyɛ nea ontumi nni so Ɔkyerɛ nsoromma dodow ɔtoto wɔn nyinaa din

On the other hand in the Scriptures we find that stars are often used to refer to persons rulers and angels
Nanso yehu wɔ Kyerɛwnsɛm mu sɛ wɔde nsoromma di dwuma mpɛn pii de gyina hɔ ma nnipa sodifo ne abɔfo
Jacob s son Joseph has a dream in which his parents are pictured as the sun and the moon and his brothers as stars
Yakob ba Yosef soo dae bi a owia ne ɔsram yɛɛ n’awofo ho mfonini na nsoromma gyinaa hɔ maa ne nuabarimanom
Angels are referred to as morning stars
Wɔfrɛ abɔfo sɛ adekyee nsoromma
Babylon s king is spoken of as aiming to be above the stars of God the Davidic rulers of the nation of Israel
Wɔka Babilon hene ho asɛm sɛ ɔrema ne ho so asen Onyankopɔn nsoromma Israel man no sodifo a wofi Dawid ase no
Unstable men in the Christian congregation are likened to stars with no set course whereas faithful bodies of congregation elders are mentioned as being stars in the right hand of Christ
Genesis Job Isaiah Jude Revelation
Wɔde nnipa a wonni nnyinaso a wɔwɔ Kristofo asafo no mu toto nsoromma a ekyinkyini ho bere a wɔka asafo mu mpanyimfo akuw a wodi nokware no ho asɛm sɛ nsoromma a wɔwɔ Kristo nsa nifa mu
Genesis Hiob Yesaia Yuda Adiyisɛm
One account in the Bible says that the stars from their orbits fought against Sisera the army chief of King Jabin of Canaan who had oppressed the nation of Israel for years
Bible mu asɛm bi ka sɛ nsoromma fifii wɔn akwan so ne Sisera Kanaan hene Yabin safohempanyin a ɔhyɛɛ Israel man so mfe no koe
Jehovah assigned Judge Barak of Israel to save Israel from bondage and gave him an overwhelming victory over Sisera even though the latter had nine hundred chariots with iron scythes on their wheels
Yehowa de hyɛɛ Ɔtemmufo Barak a ofi Israel nsa sɛ onnye Israel mfi nkoasom mu na ɔmaa no dii Sisera so nkonim kɛse ɛwom sɛ na Sisera wɔ nteaseɛnam ahankron a nnade hyehyɛ ne ntwahonan ho de
In the song of victory the Israelites sang From heaven did the stars fight from their orbits they fought against Sisera
Wɔ nkonimdi dwom no mu no Israelfo no too dwom sɛ Wofi soro bedii ako nsoromma fifii wɔn akwan so ne Sisera koe
No explanation is given as to just how the stars fought
Wɔnkyerɛkyerɛ ɔkwan pɔtee a nsoromma no faa so koe no mu
Rather than assume that the stars exercised a direct influence in the battle it is more reasonable to believe that the expression indicates some form of divine intervention in behalf of Israel
Judges

The Star of Bethlehem	Betlehem Nsoromma No 
Probably one of the best known stars mentioned in the Bible is the star of Bethlehem that guided the astrologers from eastern parts to the house where Jesus had been taken by his parents after his birth in a stable
Ebia nsoromma a wɔaka ho asɛm wɔ Bible mu a wonim no kɛse no biako ne Betlehem nsoromma no a ɛkyerɛɛ nsoromma mu ahwɛfo a wofi apuei no kwan baa ofie a na Yesu awofo de no afi baabi a wɔwoo no a ɛyɛ mmoa adididaka mu akɔ hɔ no
What was that star ?	Na ɛyɛ nsoromma bɛn ?
Certainly it was not an ordinary one since it was low enough for the astrologers to follow it for about a thousand miles km
Nokwarem no na ɛnyɛ nsoromma biara kɛkɛ esiane sɛ na ɛwɔ fam araa ma nsoromma mu ahwɛfo no tumi dii akyi twaa bɛyɛ kilomita
The star led them first to Jerusalem
Nea edi kan no nsoromma no dii wɔn anim kɔɔ Yerusalem
Hearing of this King Herod questioned them and then decided to kill the infant Jesus
Bere a Ɔhene Herode tee eyi ho asɛm no obisaa wɔn ho asɛm na afei osii gyinae sɛ obekum abofra Yesu
Then the star led the astrologers to the particular house where Jesus was living
Afei nsoromma no dii nsoromma mu ahwɛfo no anim kɔɔ ofie pɔtee a na Yesu te mu no mu
Certainly no normal star could do that
Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ nsoromma ankasa biara ntumi nyɛ saa
Did this starlike object originate with God ?	So na ade a ɛte sɛ nsoromma yi fi Onyankopɔn hɔ ?
Since the astrologers visit led indirectly to the slaughter of all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts from two years of age and under is it not reasonable to conclude that the star was something used by God s Adversary Satan in an attempt to destroy God s Son ? Matthew
Esiane sɛ nsoromma mu ahwɛfo no nsrahwɛ no na ɛkɔfaa mmarimaa a wokunkum wɔn wɔ Betlehem ne n’ahye so a wɔadi mfe abien ne wɔn a wonnya nnii nyinaa ’ bae nti so ntease nnim sɛ yɛbɛka sɛ nsoromma no yɛ ade a Onyankopɔn Tamfo Satan na ɔde dii dwuma de bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛsɛe Onyankopɔn Ba no ? Mateo
It should also be borne in mind that the astrologers came from the East perhaps from Babylon which was an ancient center of magic sorcery and astrology
Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛkae nso sɛ na nsoromma mu ahwɛfo no fi Apuei Fam ebia na wofi Babilon a na ɛyɛ tete kurow titiriw a na woyi nkonyaa yɛ asumansɛm na wɔhwɛ nsoromma mu wɔ hɔ no
A number of heavenly bodies have been named after Babylon s gods

In the days of King Nebuchadnezzar divination was used to help him decide which route to take in his battle campaign
Ezekiel

Hesekiel
The prophet Isaiah challenged Babylon s counselors saying You Babylon are powerless in spite of the advice you get
Odiyifo Yesaia twaa Babilon afotufo mpoa kae sɛ Wo Babilon wunni tumi biara ɛmfa ho afotu a wunya
Let your astrologers come forward and save you those people who study the stars who map out the zones of the heavens and tell you from month to month what is going to happen to you
Ma wo nsoromma mu ahwɛfo nsɔre nnyina na wonnye wo nkwa saa nkurɔfo a wɔhwɛ nsoromma mu a wɔkyekyɛ ɔsoro mu na daa ɔsram wɔka nea ɛbɛba wo so kyerɛ wo no
They will be like bits of straw and a fire will burn them up !	Wɔbɛyɛ sɛ sare nketenkete na ogya bi bɛhyew wɔn !
They will not even be able to save themselves

Ronan East Asian History of Science Trust Cambridge England nnwuma sohwɛfo ne obi a ɔboa ma wɔkyerɛw The International Encyclopedia of Astronomy a emu na wɔfaa asɛm yi fii no
To illustrate this subjectivity Ronan explains that while to the Western mind the red planet Mars is associated with war and belligerence to the Chinese red is a beautiful color and Mars is viewed as having a benign influence

In contrast Western mythology associates Venus with white and beauty
Nea ɛne eyi bɔ abira no Atɔe Famfo atetesɛm kyerɛ sɛ Venus yɛ fitaa na ɛyɛ fɛ
To the Chinese white
is considered the colour of death decay and destruction Venus was therefore referred to as the gloomy planet of war

What We Can Learn From the Stars	Nea Yebetumi Asua wɔ Nsoromma Ho
However the inanimate stars can tell us something if we are willing to listen
Nanso nsoromma a nkwa nnim no betumi aka biribi akyerɛ yɛn sɛ yɛpɛ sɛ yetie a
Edwin Way Teale wrote The stars speak of man s insignificance in the long eternity of time
Edwin Way Teale kyerɛwee sɛ Nsoromma no ka sɛnea nnipa nsɛ hwee wɔ mmeresanten mu no ho asɛm
Yes when we realize that the vast majority of the stars we see with our naked eye on a clear night were seen by our ancestors centuries ago does it not humble us ?

Do we not feel reverence for the Majestic One who created them in the beginning and who later brought forth mankind ?	So yennya obu mma Opumpuni a ɔyɛɛ wɔn mfiase no na akyiri yi ɔbɔɔ nnipa no ?
King David of Israel reverently wrote When I see your heavens the works of your fingers the moon and the stars that you have prepared what is mortal man that you keep him in mind and the son of earthling man that you take care of him ? 	Israel hene Dawid fii obu mu kyerɛwee sɛ Sɛ mehwɛ wo soro wo nsateaa ano adwuma ɔsram ne nsoromma a woasiesie a ɔdesani ne hena a wokae no na onipa ba ne hena a w’ani ku ne ho ? 
The heavens should humble us and make us question what we are doing with our lives
Genesis Psalm

Genesis Dwom
On one occasion David prayed Teach me to do your will for you are my God
Dawid bɔɔ mpae bere bi sɛ Kyerɛkyerɛ me nea wopɛ yɛ na wone me Nyankopɔn
The record of David s life indicates that his prayer was answered
Dawid asetra ho kyerɛwtohɔ kyerɛ sɛ wobuaa ne mpaebɔ no
He learned to do God s will as set out in His Law
Osuae sɛ ɔbɛyɛ Onyankopɔn apɛde sɛnea na wɔakyerɛw wɔ Ne Mmara mu no
He also learned the Creator s purpose for mankind and he wrote about it
Osuaa Ɔbɔadeɛ no atirimpɔw ma adesamma ho ade nso na ɔkyerɛw ho asɛm
Just a little while longer and the wicked one will be no more
Aka kakraa sɛ na ɔbɔnefo nni hɔ
But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace
Na ahobrɛasefo benya asase no adi na wɔagye wɔn ani asomdwoe bebree mu
Turn away from what is bad and do what is good and so reside to time indefinite
Fi bɔne ho na yɛ papa na woatra hɔ daa
The righteous themselves will possess the earth and they will reside forever upon it
Treneefo benya asase no adi na wɔatra so daapem
With knowledge of that purpose came a responsibility Turn away from what is bad and do what is good

Ɛsɛ sɛ nsoromma ho ade a wosua de hwehwɛ ɛho nimdeɛ a ɛne nsoromma mu hwɛ bɔ abira no ma yenya obu wɔ yɛn koma mu
But more than that does it not implant in us the desire to learn more about God ?	Nanso nea ɛsen saa no so ɛmma yennya ɔpɛ wɔ yɛn mu sɛ yebesua Onyankopɔn ho ade pii ?
He has provided his Word the Bible for that very purpose
Saa atirimpɔw no nti na ɔde n’Asɛm Bible no ama
If you have discerned this message from the stars you can learn what Jehovah has in store for mankind and more important how you can share in the blessings he has prepared for them

His Epistle to Timothy she added reveals his thinking But I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
Timothy King James Version

When Paul wrote with respect to the role or station of women was it simply his personal opinion that was being expressed or was he divinely inspired ?	Bere a Paulo kyerɛw mmea dwumadi anaa wɔn dibea ho asɛm no so na ɛyɛ n’ankasa adwene na ɔreda no adi anaa wɔde honhom na ɛkaa no ma ɔkyerɛwee ?
Viewed in their entirety do the epistles or letters of Paul truly reflect an antifemale bias ?	Sɛ wususuw Paulo nhoma anaa nkrataa no nyinaa ho a so ɛda no adi sɛ ɔyɛ nyiyim tia mmea ankasa ?
In what context do the words of Paul to Timothy quoted above apply ?	Paulo nsɛm a ɔkyerɛw kɔmaa Timoteo a wɔafa aka asɛm wɔ atifi hɔ no fa dɛn ho ankasa ?
Paul s Credentials	Paulo ho Adanse Ahorow
Of the books of the Christian Greek Scriptures are attributed to Paul
Paulo na wɔkyerɛ sɛ ɔkyerɛw Kristofo Hela Kyerɛwnsɛm mu nhoma no mu
Indicative of the operation of holy spirit upon him was his miraculous ability to speak in many tongues
Adanse a ɛkyerɛ sɛ na honhom kronkron wɔ no so ne kasa horow pii a otumi kae a na ɛyɛ nwonwa no
Additionally he attested to supernatural visions
Nea ɛka ho bio no odii adanse sɛ onyaa anisoadehu pii a ɛyɛ nwonwa
His self sacrificing whole souled and loving example engendered a close bond of warm brotherly affection between him and his Christian contemporaries
Ne ho a ɔde bɔɔ afɔre ɔkra nyinaa mu a ofi yɛɛ ade ne ɔdɔ ho nhwɛso a ɔyɛe no maa ɔne ne bere so Kristofo nyaa abusuabɔ a emu yɛ den a onuadɔ wom
His writings including what he said about women form part of the all Scripture
inspired of God and beneficial for teaching

Women in Paul s Letters	Mmea ho Nsɛm a Ɛwɔ Paulo Nkrataa Mu
Paul s recognition of and regard for women are in ample evidence throughout his writings
Gye a na Paulo gye mmea tom ne obu a na ɔwɔ ma wɔn no da adi kɛse wɔ ne nhoma ahorow nyinaa mu
Repeatedly he makes reference to them in their varied congregational and family roles
Ɔkaa dwuma horow a wodi wɔ asafo no ne abusua mu ho nsɛm mpɛn pii
In one of his letters he likened the desirable qualities of a Christian shepherd to those displayed by a nursing mother
Thessalonians
Wɔ ne krataa biako mu no ɔde Kristofo nguanhwɛfo su pa totoo nea ɔbaatan da no adi ho
Tesalonikafo
Many of the apostle s Christian sisters mentioned by name in his letters are the subjects of his warm commendation
Ɔsomafo no Kristofo nuabeanom a ɔbobɔɔ wɔn din wɔ ne nkrataa mu no pii yɛ nkurɔfo a n’ankasa fi ɔdɔ mu kamfoo wɔn
Included in his greetings to members of the congregation in Rome were those addressed specifically to certain women working hard in the Lord
Wɔn a wɔka ne nkyia a ɔde kɔmaa Roma asafo no mufo ho ne mmea bi a wɔbɔ Awurade mu mmɔden a ɔbobɔɔ wɔn din kyiakyiaa wɔn no
With reference to Euodia and Syntyche he encouraged the brothers in Philippi to keep assisting these women who have striven side by side with me in the good news
Ɛdefa Euodia ne Sintike ho no ɔhyɛɛ Filipi anuanom no nkuran sɛ wɔnso wɔn mu abia efisɛ wɔn na wɔkaa ne ho peree asɛmpa no
’
In his letter to Timothy Paul acknowledged the exemplary faith of that young man s grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice
Timothy
Wɔ Paulo krataa a ɔkyerɛw kɔmaa Timoteo mu no ɔkaa saa aberante no nanabea Lois ne ne na Eunike gyidi ho nhwɛso pa no ho asɛm
Timoteo
In turn is there any indication as to how Paul s Christian sisters felt about him ?	Ɛno akyi no so biribi wɔ hɔ a ɛkyerɛ sɛnea Paulo Kristofo nuabeanom tee nka wɔ ne ho ?
Gratefully he testified concerning Aquila and Prisca a married couple with whom he had close personal association that not only Aquila but also his wife Prisca risked their own necks for his soul
Romans
Nea ɛyɛ anigye ne sɛ odii Akwila ne Priska awarefo a ɔne wɔn nyaa ayɔnkofa a emu yɛ den ho adanse sɛ ɛnyɛ Akwila nko na mmom ne yere Priska nso ka ho na wɔde wɔn ankasa kɔn momae de sii ne kra ananmu

Antifemale Bias ?	So na Ɔyɛ Nyiyim Tia Mmea ?
 Do not severely criticize an older man
To the contrary entreat him as a father younger men as brothers older women as mothers younger women as sisters with all chasteness
Mpoopoo w’ani nkyerɛ ɔpanyin na mmom tu no fo sɛ agya mmerante sɛ anuanom mmea mpanyin sɛ ɛnanom mmabaa sɛ nuabeanom wɔ ahotew nyinaa mu
Do not these words of Paul to Timothy reflect a wholesome respect for womankind ?	So Paulo nsɛm yi a ɔkyerɛw kɔmaa Timoteo no nna obu a ɛfata a ɔwɔ ma mmea adi ?
Paul assigned to men and women in the Christian congregation an equal measure of honor
Paulo dii mmarima ne mmea a wɔwɔ Kristofo asafo no mu nyinaa ni pɛpɛɛpɛ
There is neither Jew nor Greek he wrote there is neither slave nor freeman there is neither male nor female for you are all one person in union with Christ Jesus
Galatians
Ɔkyerɛwee sɛ Yudani anaa Helani nni hɔ akoa anaa ɔdehye nni hɔ ɔbarima anaa ɔbea nni hɔ bio efisɛ mo nyinaa yɛ biako Kristo Yesu mu
’ Galatifo
With respect to the God assigned roles in marriage Paul wrote Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord because a husband is head of his wife as the Christ also is head of the congregation he being a savior of this body
Ɛdefa afa a Onyankopɔn de ama wɔ aware mu ho no Paulo kyerɛwee sɛ Ɔyerenom mommrɛ mo ho ase mma mo ankasa mo kununom sɛ moyɛ ma Awurade efisɛ okunu yɛ ɔyere ti sɛ Kristo nso yɛ asafo no ti no na ɔne nipadua no agyenkwa
Yes the respective roles of husband and wife differ but this does not imply that one mate is inferior
Yiw nsonsonoe wɔ afa a okunu ne ɔyere wɔ no mu nanso eyi nkyerɛ sɛ ahokafo no biako ba fam
The roles are complementary and the fulfillment of each constitutes a challenge that promotes family well being if met
Afanu no mu biara boa ɔfoforo na afa no mu biara ho dwuma a wodi no yiye no yɛ den na ɛma abusua no di yiye
Further the husbandly exercise of headship was not to be oppressive or unloving
Afei nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ okununom ma wɔn tiyɛ a wodi no yɛ nhyɛso anaa nea ɔdɔ nnim
Continued Paul Husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies being willing to make major sacrifices for them
Paulo toaa so sɛ Ɛsɛ okununom sɛ wɔdɔ wɔn ankasa wɔn yerenom sɛ wɔn ankasa nipadua a wɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔde nneɛma akɛse bɛbɔ afɔre ama wɔn
Children were to obey both father and mother
Ephesians
Na ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra tie agya ne ɛna nyinaa asɛm
Efesofo
To be noted too are Paul s words with regard to marital intimacies
Ade foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛhyɛ no nsow nso ne nsɛm a Paulo ka faa aware mu nkitahodi ho no
It was with impartiality that Paul wrote Let the husband render to his wife her due but let the wife also do likewise to her husband
Na Paulo nyɛ nyiyim bere a ɔkyerɛw eyi no Okunu mma ɔyere nea ɛsɛ na ɔyere nso mma okunu saa ara
The wife does not exercise authority over her own body but her husband does likewise also the husband does not exercise authority over his own body but his wife does
Corinthians
Ɔyere nni n’ankasa ne nipadua so tumi na mmom okunu saa ara nso na okunu nni n’ankasa ne nipadua so tumi na mmom ɔyere

Woman
to Be in Silence 	 Ɔbea de
Ɔnyɛ Komm 
In reference to Paul s words at Timothy quoted in the opening paragraph did his advocacy of womanly silence stem from an antifemale bias ?	Ɛdefa Paulo nsɛm a ɛwɔ Timoteo a yɛafa mu asɛm aka wɔ nkyekyem a edi kan no mu ho no so ka a ɔkae sɛ mmea nyɛ komm no kyerɛ sɛ na ɔyɛ nyiyim tia mmea ?
No !	Dabi !
The silence called for was in relation to teaching and exercising spiritual authority in the congregation this out of regard for the earlier mentioned divinely prescribed man woman relationship
Komm a na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no fa asafo no mu nkyerɛkyerɛ ne honhom fam tumidi ho na na eyi gyina ɔbarima ne ɔbea ntam abusuabɔ a Onyankopɔn de ama a yɛadi kan aka ho asɛm no so
This does not mean that women cannot be teachers of divine truth
Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ mmea ntumi nyɛ ɔsoro nokware no ho akyerɛkyerɛfo
Paul encouraged older women to be teachers of what is good to younger women
Paulo hyɛɛ mmerewa nkuran sɛ wɔnkyerɛkyerɛ mmabaa nsɛm pa
In following the example of Eunice and Lois who instructed Timothy Christian mothers are to train their children in godly ways
Bere a ɛnanom Kristofo redi Eunike ne Lois a wɔkyerɛkyerɛɛ Timoteo no nhwɛso akyi no ɛsɛ sɛ wɔtete wɔn mma wɔ Onyankopɔn akwan so
Today in congregations of Jehovah s Witnesses hundreds of thousands of Christian women find spiritual fulfillment in following the examples of Euodia and Syntyche in preaching the good news publicly and in making disciples of men and women
Psalm Matthew Philippians
Ɛnnɛ wɔ Yehowa Adansefo asafo ahorow mu no Kristofo mmea ɔpehaha pii nya honhom mu abotɔyam bere a wodi Euodia ne Sintike nhwɛso no akyi na wɔka asɛmpa no wɔ baguam na wɔyɛ mmarima ne mmea asuafo no

Thus what is your assessment ?	Enti dɛn na wususuw ?
Do Paul s writings viewed in their entirety justify the charge of antifemale bias ?	Sɛ wohwɛ Paulo nhoma ahorow no nyinaa a so edi adanse sɛ na ɔyɛ nyiyim tia mmea ?

The Decay of Manners	Suban Pa Asɛe
Millions still practice good manners
Nnipa ɔpepem pii da so ara yi suban pa adi
Other millions trample them underfoot
Ɔpepem pii nso mfa nyɛ hwee
AT THE turn of the century etiquette got off on the wrong foot according to The New Encyclop dia Britannica In the late th and early th centuries those in the upper strata of society regarded the observance of the most trivial demands of etiquette as at once a diversion and for the women an occupation
ANIBUE nyaa mfiase bɔne wɔ afeha no mfiase sɛnea The New Encyclop dia Britannica kyerɛ no Wɔ afeha a ɛto so awiei ne afeha a ɛto so mfiase no wiase mu nnipa atitiriw no buu nneɛma nketenkete koraa a wɔyɛ de kyerɛ sɛ wɔapɔw no sɛ biribi a wɔyɛ de gye wɔn ani bere a na ɛyɛ mmea ahiasɛm
More and more elaborate rituals were designed to create a sense of exclusiveness for the initiates and to keep the unworthy ignorant of them at a distance
Wɔhyehyɛɛ suban pa ho gyinapɛn pii a ɛkɔ akyiri sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a afoforo a wɔabɛka wɔn ho no bɛte nka sɛ wɔda nsow na wɔn a wɔmfata wɔn a wonnim ho hwee no antumi ammɛn wɔn
That is a far cry from what good manners should be
Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛsɛ sɛ suban pa yɛ koraa
Amy Vanderbilt is a respected authority on the subject of manners and she writes in her New Complete Book of Etiquette The finest rules for behavior are to be found in Chapter of First Corinthians the beautiful dissertation on charity by St

These rules have nothing to do with the fine points of dress nor with those of superficial manners
Saa ahyɛde ahorow yi ne ntadehyɛ ho nsɛm a ɛkɔ akyiri nni hwee yɛ na saa ara na ɛne nnipa ani so suban pa nni hwee yɛ
They have to do with feelings and attitudes kindliness and consideration of others
Ɛfa nkate ne su horow ayamye ne afoforo ho a wosusuw ho
What Amy Vanderbilt referred to is the Biblical passage at Corinthians which says Love is long suffering and kind
Love is not jealous it does not brag does not get puffed up does not behave indecently does not look for its own interests does not become provoked
It does not keep account of the injury
It does not rejoice over unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth
Nea Amy Vanderbilt kaa ho asɛm ne Bible mu asɛm a ɛwɔ Korintofo no nea ese Ɔdɔ wɔ abodwokyɛre ne yam ye ɔdɔ nyɛ ahoɔyaw ɔdɔ nyɛ ahoahoa ɛnhoran ɛnyɛ ne ho sɛnea ɛmfata ɛnhwehwɛ nea ɛyɛ n’ankasa de ne bo nhaw no ɛmfa bɔne nhyɛ ne yam n’ani nnye nea ɛnteɛ ho na ɛne nokware ani gye
It bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
Etie ade nyinaa egye ade nyinaa di enya ade nyinaa mu anidaso ɛtɔ ne bo ase ade nyinaa mu
Love never fails
Ɔdɔ to ntwa da
What a rarity it would be to see love like this practiced today !	Hwɛ sɛnea anka ɛbɛyɛ ade a ɛsom bo koraa sɛ wubehu sɛ wɔde ɔdɔ a ɛte sɛɛ reyɛ adwuma nnɛ !
Everywhere all manners would be impeccable !	Anka su horow nyinaa bɛyɛ nea asɛm nni ho wɔ mmaa nyinaa !
The starting point in teaching and learning such manners is the Christian home
Beae a edi kan a wɔkyerɛ na wosua su horow a ɛte saa ne Kristofo fie
A family is a delicate machine whose parts are in close contact with one another
Abusua te sɛ afiri bi a n’afa horow no fomfam ho a ɛho dwumadi gye ahwɛyiye kɛse
Only expert lubrication can keep it in smooth running order
Sɛ wogugu mu yiye nkutoo a na ebetumi abom ayɛ adwuma yiye
Knowing how to be helpful courteous pleasant and polite will go a long way toward making a home happy
Hu a yebehu sɛnea yɛbɛboa afoforo yebedi wɔn ni na yɛada animtew ne suban pa adi no bɛboa kɛse ma ofie ayɛ anigye
Learning how to voice the accepted everyday expressions of courtesy and consideration such as Thank you Please Forgive me I m sorry will do much to eliminate destructive friction in our associations
Sua a yebesua kasadɛ a wɔka no da biara da te sɛ Meda wo ase Mesrɛ wo Fa kyɛ me Mepa wo kyɛw no bɛboa kɛse ma yɛayi nsɛm nketenkete a ɛsɛe ade afi yɛn fekubɔ mu
These are little words with big meanings

Everyone can say them properly
Obiara betumi aka no yiye
They cost us nothing but with them we buy friends
Yɛntɔ nanso yetumi de nya nnamfo
If we daily practice good manners in our homes they will not leave us when we go outside the family circle and mingle with the public
Sɛ yeyi suban pa adi wɔ yɛn afie mu da biara a ɛbɛka yɛn ho bere a yɛne afoforo a wonni yɛn abusua no mu bɔ fekuw no
Good manners involve showing consideration for the feelings of others according them respect treating them as we would like for them to treat us
Suban pa hwehwɛ sɛ yesusuw afoforo nkate ho kyerɛ obu ma wɔn na yɛne wɔn di nsɛm sɛnea yɛbɛpɛ sɛ wɔne yɛn di no
Many have noted however that manners themselves have undergone a breakdown
Nanso nnipa pii ahu sɛ suban pa ankasa kɔ fam
One writer said We are wanting in courtesy because individualism has gained the upper hand
Ɔkyerɛwfo bi kae sɛ Yɛtɔ sin wɔ suban pa mu efisɛ pɛsɛmenkominya abedi akoten
Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer wrote Selfishness is such a horrible thing that we invented politeness to conceal it
Nyansapɛfo Arthur Schopenhauer kyerɛwee sɛ Pɛsɛmenkominya yɛ akyide araa ma yɛpɛɛ suban pa de kataa so

However as it has been said rudeness is a weak man s imitation of strength
Nanso wɔaka sɛ akakabensɛm na ohufo de kyerɛ sɛ ne bo yɛ duru
The laws men have compiled to manage the conduct of humanity would fill a library yet they have not resulted in the guidance humanity needs
Mmara horow a nnipa ayeyɛ na wɔde adi nnipa su horow so no dɔɔso yiye nanso ɛmfaa akwankyerɛ a nnipa hia no mmae
Do we need still more ?	So yebehia pii aka ho ?
Or maybe fewer ?	Anaa ebia yebehia kakraa bi ?
It has been said that the better a society is the less law it needs
Wɔaka sɛ dodow a nnipa abusua bi ye no dodow no ara na mmara a wohia no yɛ kakraa bi
How about just one law ?	Na sɛ ɛyɛ mmara biako pɛ nso ɛ ?
This one for example All things therefore that you want men to do to you you also must likewise do to them this in fact is what the Law and the Prophets mean
Matthew
Sɛ nhwɛso no eyi Enti ade biara a mopɛ sɛ nnipa nyɛ mma mo no mo nso monyɛ wɔn saa ara na eyi na mmara ne adiyifo no kyerɛ
Mateo
Obedience to that law would sweep away most of the current problems but still to complete the needs of society a more important law must be added You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength
Mark
Saa mmara no sodi betumi ayi mprempren nsɛnnennen no fa kɛse afi hɔ nanso ɛno akyi no nea ɛbɛyɛ a wobedi nnipa abusua ahiade nyinaa ho dwuma no ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde mmara bi a ɛho hia sen ɛno ka ho Dɔ Yehowa wo Nyankopɔn fi wo koma nyinaa mu ne wo kra nyinaa mu ne w’adwene nyinaa mu ne w’ahoɔden nyinaa mu

Today s society dismisses both of these Biblical requirements as unnecessary along with any other guidelines contained in the Bible
Ɛnnɛ nnipa bɔ Bible ahwehwɛde abien yi nyinaa ne akwankyerɛ afoforo biara a ɛwɔ Bible no mu no gu sɛ ɛho nhia
The Bible speaks of such ones at Jeremiah The wise ones have become ashamed
Bible no ka saafo no ho asɛm wɔ Yeremia sɛ Anyansafo ani bewu
They have rejected the very word of Jehovah and what wisdom do they have ? 	 Yehowa asɛm na wɔapa yi na nyansa bɛn na wɔwɔ ? 
They also see no need for a public consensus on the true values that have traditionally been recognized as essential for our guidance
Afei nso wonhu hia a ɛho hia biara sɛ amanfo nyinaa begye su a ɛfata ankasa a wofi tete abu no sɛ ɛho hia ma yɛn akwankyerɛ no atom
Their new morality is a broad way that gives room for any alternative life styles that individuals may choose the broad way that Jesus identified as the road leading off into destruction and many are the ones going off into it
Matthew
Wɔn abrabɔ foforo no yɛ ɔkwan a ɛtrɛw a ɛma ankorankoro tumi paw asetra kwan foforo biara a wɔpɛ ɔkwan a ɛtrɛw a Yesu daa no adi sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan a ɛkɔ ɔsɛe mu no na nnipa pii na wɔnam so

The Perfect Example	Nhwɛso a Ɛyɛ Pɛ
Jesus Christ the one who is in the bosom position with the Father is an outstanding example worthy of imitation
Yesu Kristo nea ɔda agya no kokom no yɛɛ nhwɛso a ɛda nsow a ɛsɛ sɛ yesuasua
In dealing with people he was tender and compassionate on the one hand forceful and firm on the other yet he was never rude or unkind to anyone
Bere a ɔne nnipa dii nsɛm no ɔyɛɛ bɔkɔɔ na oyii mmɔborohunu adi na bere koro no ara nso wantoto nneɛma ase na ɔde ne nan sii fam nanso wammu obiara abomfiaa anaa wammɔ no atirimɔden da
Commenting on his extraordinary gift of being at ease with all sorts of persons the book The Man From Nazareth says of Jesus Alike in public and in private he associated with men and women on equal terms
Bere a nhoma The Man From Nazareth reka Yesu akyɛde soronko a ɛne sɛ na ɔne nnipa nyinaa ka ho asɛm no ese Ɔne mmarima ne mmea bɔe wɔ baguam ne kokoam nyinaa a animhwɛ nnim
He was at home with little children in their innocence and strangely enough at home too with conscience stricken grafters like Zacchaeus
Na ɔne mmofra nkumaa a wɔn ho nni asɛm ka na nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse no na ɔne amimfo a wɔn ahonim bu wɔn fɔ te sɛ Sakeo nso ka
Respectable home keeping women such as Mary and Martha could talk with him with natural frankness but courtesans also sought him out as though assured that he would understand and befriend them
Na mmea a wɔyɛ afiehwɛfo a wobu wɔn te sɛ Maria ne Marta tumi fi wɔn pɛ mu ne no kasa a wɔmfa nsɛm nsie no nanso nguaman nso hwehwɛɛ n’akyi kwan te sɛ nea ebia wɔwɔ awerɛhyem sɛ ɔbɛte wɔn ase na ɔne wɔn anya ayɔnkofa
His strange unawareness of boundaries that hemmed ordinary people in is one of his most characteristic qualities
Mmara ahorow a wɔde kyekyeree mpapahwekwaa a wannye antom maa ɛyɛɛ nwonwa no yɛ ne su horow a ɛda nsow sen biara no biako
Jehovah God is always mannerly when dealing with those below him often adding please to his requests
Sɛ Yehowa Nyankopɔn ne wɔn a wɔhyɛ n’ase di nsɛm a oyi suban pa adi bere nyinaa na ɔtaa ka mesrɛ wo wɔ n’adebisa ahorow mu
When granting his friend Abraham a blessing he said Raise your eyes please and look from the place where you are
Bere a na ɔrehyira n’adamfo Abraham no ɔkae sɛ Mesrɛ wo ma w’ani so na fi nea wowɔ hwɛ
And again Look up please to the heavens and count the stars
Bio nso Mesrɛ wo ma wo ti so hwɛ wim na kan nsoromma no
When giving Moses a sign of His power God said Stick your hand please into the upper fold of your garment
Bere a Onyankopɔn reyɛ sɛnkyerɛnne bi de akyerɛ Mose Ne tumi no ɔkae sɛ Mesrɛ wo fa wo nsa hyɛ w’atade no soro
Many years later Jehovah through his prophet Micah said even to his wayward people Hear please you heads of Jacob and you commanders of the house of Israel
Mfe pii akyi no Yehowa nam ne diyifo Mika so ka kyerɛɛ ne nkurɔfo a wɔnam akwammɔne so no mpo sɛ Mesrɛ mo muntie Yakob atitiriw ne Israel fi atemmufo
Hear please this you head ones
Mesrɛ mo muntie mo atitiriw
In this respect have we become imitators of God in saying please when dealing with others ? Ephesians
Wɔ eyi mu no so yɛabɛyɛ wɔn a wosuasua Onyankopɔn ’ ka sɛ mesrɛ wo bere a yɛne afoforo di nsɛm no ? Efesofo
So what guidelines or moral precepts do the worldly wise offer as replacements for the Biblical ones they reject as unacceptable ?	Enti akwankyerɛ anaa abrabɔ mu nnyinasosɛm bɛn na wiase anyansafo no de si Bible no de a wɔpow na wɔkyerɛ sɛ ɛmfata no ananmu ?

Manners Rejected by the New Morality ?	Suban Pa Yɛ Nea Abrabɔ Foforo No Apow Anaa ?
 Woe to those putting bad for good dark for light bitter for sweet
Isaiah
Wonnue wɔn a wɔde bɔne yɛ papa hann yɛ sum nwenenwene yɛ fremfrem no
’ Yesaia
THE th century saw sweeping changes in manners and morals
WƆYƐƐ nsakrae pii wɔ suban pa ne abrabɔ mu wɔ afeha a ɛto so no mu
In the decades that followed the two world wars the old value systems gradually came to be viewed as outmoded
Wɔ mfe a edii wiase ko abien no akyi mu no wɔde nkakrankakra buu suban pa dedaw no sɛ ne bere atwam
Changing conditions and new theories in the fields of human behavior and science convinced many that the old values were no longer valid
Tebea horow a na ɛresakra ne nnipa nneyɛe ne nyansahu mu nkyerɛkyerɛ afoforo maa nnipa pii begye dii sɛ su dedaw no nyɛ adwuma bio
Manners once held in high regard were shed as excess baggage
Su horow bi a bere bi na wobu no sɛ ɛsom bo no yɛ nea wɔpowee sɛ adesoa bi
Bible guidelines once respected were rejected as outmoded
Bible akwankyerɛ ahorow a na wɔkyerɛ obu wɔ ho no yɛ nea wɔpowee sɛ biribi a ne bere atwam
They were much too restrictive for the freewheeling liberated society of ultramodern individuals of the th century
Na ɛyɛ akwanside kɛse paa ma abusua a wɔyɛ nea wɔpɛ a afeha a ɛto so mu ankorankoro a nea aba so foforo agye wɔn adwene na wɔwom no
The year that saw this turning point in human history was
Afe a saa nsakrae yi baa nnipa abakɔsɛm mu no ne
The writings of historians concerning that year and World War I are replete with their observations declaring to be a year of momentous change a real marker dividing epochs in human history
Nsɛm a abakɔsɛm akyerɛwfo de bɔɔ saa afe no ne Wiase Ko I ho dawuru ayɛ wɔn nkyerɛwee mu ma na wɔka sɛ yɛ afe a ɛde nsakrae akɛse bae na ɛyɛ agyiraehyɛde ankasa a ɛma wohu nnipa abakɔsɛm mu mmere atitiriw
The Roaring Twenties charged in on the heels of the war and people tried to catch up on the fun missed during those war years
Ɔko no akyi pɛɛ na Afe Apem Ahankron Aduonu Mfe a na Ɛrebobom No bae na nkurɔfo bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wobenya anigyede a wɔhweree wɔ ɔko mfe no mu no ahyem
Old values and inconvenient moral restraints were brushed aside to clear the way for the fun splurge
Wɔbɔɔ su dedaw no ne abrabɔ ho mmara ahorow a wɔn ani nnye ho no too nkyɛn na ama wɔanya anigyede a ɛtra so
A new morality indulging fleshly pursuits was informally installed basically an anything goes approach
Wɔde abrabɔ foforo a ɛmaa ɔhonam akɔnnɔ ho kwan sii hɔ a wɔamfa anto gua nokwarem no wɔmaa biribiara ho kwan
The new moral code inevitably carried with it a change in manners
Abrabɔ mmara foforo no maa suban pa sakrae a na wontumi nyɛ ho hwee
Historian Frederick Lewis Allen comments on this Another result of the revolution was that manners became not merely different but for a few years unmannerly
Abakɔsɛm Kyerɛwfo Frederick Lewis Allen ka eyi ho asɛm Ade foforo a nsakrae no de bae ne sɛ suban pa ammɛyɛ soronko kɛkɛ na mmom wɔ mfe kakraa bi mu no nea ɛmfata
During this decade hostesses
found that their guests couldn t be bothered to speak to them on arrival or departure that gate crashing at dances became an accepted practice people were fashionably late for dinners left burning cigarettes about scattered ashes on rugs without apology
Wɔ saa mfe yi mu no mmea a wɔhwɛ adididan ahorow

The old bars were down no new ones had been built and meanwhile the pigs were in the pasture
Na wɔadwiriw nhyɛsode dedaw no agu a wonnya nsii foforo na saa bere no na mprako ate asi dontori mu
Some day perhaps the ten years which followed the war may aptly be known as the decade of Bad Manners
Ebia da bi wɔbɛfrɛ mfe du a edii ɔko no akyi no Suban Bɔne mfe ma afata
If the decade was ill mannered it was also unhappy
Sɛ na suban pa nni mfe du no mu a na anigye nso nnim
With the old order of things had gone a set of values which had given richness and meaning to life and substitute values were not easily found
Nhyehyɛe dedaw no ne su a ɛmaa asetra yɛɛ anigye na enyaa atirimpɔw no boom kɔe na anyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobenya su afoforo asi ananmu
Substitute values that restored richness and meaning to life were never found
Wɔannya su afoforo a ɛbɛma asetra asan ayɛ anigye na anya atirimpɔw ansi ananmu da
They were not sought after
Wɔanhwehwɛ akyi kwan
The exciting anything goes life style of the Roaring Twenties freed people of moral constraints which suited them just fine
Afe Apem Ahankron Aduonu Mfe a na Ɛrebobom No asetra kwan a na ɛma biribiara ho kwan no na ɛkanyan nnipa maa wɔdee wɔn ho wɔ abrabɔ fam anohyeto ahorow ho na saa ara na na wɔpɛ no
They were not casting morality aside they were just revising it loosening it up a bit
Ɛnyɛ sɛ na wɔde abrabɔ reto nkyɛn na wɔreyɛ no foforo kɛkɛ wɔregow mu kakra
In time they called it the New Morality
Bere kɔɔ so no wɔfrɛɛ no Abrabɔ Foforo
In it each one does what s right in his own eyes
Wɔ ɛno mu no obiara yɛ nea ɛteɛ wɔ n’ani so
He s number one
Ɔsen afoforo nyinaa
He does his own thing
Ɔyɛ nea n’ankasa pɛ
He blazes his own trail
Ɔfa n’ankasa kwan so
Or so he thinks
Ebia saa na osusuw
Actually three thousand years ago wise King Solomon said There is nothing new under the sun
Nokwarem no mfe mpem abiɛsa a atwam no onyansafo Ɔhene Salomo kae sɛ Ade foforo biara nni hɔ owia ase
Even earlier during the period of the Judges Israelites had considerable latitude as to whether they would obey God s Law or not In those days there was no king in Israel
What was right in his own eyes was what each one was accustomed to do
Wɔ Atemmufo no bere a edii eyi anim no mu mpo Israelfo nyaa ahofadi pii a wɔde betie Onyankopɔn Mmara anaa wɔde bɛpow Nna no mu no na ɔhene bi nni Israel obiara yɛ nea ɛtɛe n’ani so
But the majority proved unwilling to heed the Law
Nanso dodow noara powee sɛ wobetie Mmara no
By sowing this way Israel reaped hundreds of years of national disasters
Israel nam aba a woguu no saa kwan yi so de ɔhaw pii baa ɔman no mu mfehaha pii
Similarly nations today have reaped centuries of pain and suffering and the worst is yet to come
Saa ara na ɛnnɛ amanaman atwa ɛyaw ne amanehunu mfehaha pii na afei mpo na nea enye koraa no rebɛba
There is another term that identifies the New Morality more specifically namely relativism
Asɛm foforo bi wɔ hɔ a ɛda Abrabɔ Foforo no adi pefee a ɛne ankorankoro gyinapɛn
Webster s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines it thus A view that ethical truths depend on the individuals and groups holding them
Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛɛ Adwene a ɛne sɛ abrabɔ mu nokwasɛm ahorow gyina ankorankoro anaa nnipakuw a wokura mu no so
In a nutshell the disciples of relativism contend that whatever is good for them is ethical for them
Ne tiatwa mu no wɔn a wogye ankorankoro gyinapɛn tom no kyerɛ sɛ biribiara a eye ma wɔn no yɛ abrabɔ pa ma wɔn
One writer enlarged upon relativism when he said Relativism long lurking below the surface emerged as the prevailing philosophy of the me decade of the seventies it reigns still in the yuppieism of the eighties
Ɔkyerɛwfo bi kaa ankorankoro gyinapɛn ho asɛm kɔɔ akyiri bere a ɔkae sɛ Ankorankoro gyinapɛn a na ɛso akata bere tenten no bɛdaa adi wɔ adwene a na wɔwɔ wɔ afe apem ahankron aduɔson ahopɛ mfe ’ no mu ɛda so da adi wɔ afe apem ahankron aduɔwɔtwe mfe no nnɛmmafo akɛsesɛm no mu
We may still give lip service to traditional values but in practice the right is whatever is good for me
Ebia na yɛda so ara de yɛn anofafa kamfo tete su ahorow nanso wɔ nneyɛe mu de nea eye ma me ne ade a ɛteɛ
And that includes manners If it suits me I ll do it if it doesn t I won t
Na suban pa nso ho asɛm ba mu Sɛ eye ma me a mɛyɛ sɛ ɛnte saa a menyɛ
It wouldn t be right for me even if it were more mannerly for you
Sɛ ɛbɛfata ama wo yiye mpo a enye mma me
It would ruin my radical individualism make me look weak turn me into a wimp
Ɛmma menna nsow sɛnea ɛfata ɛbɛma mayɛ te sɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw na madan nipa hunu
’
Apparently for such people this applies not just to acts of rudeness but also to such easy everyday niceties as Please I m sorry Excuse me Thank you Let me get the door for you Take my seat Let me carry that package for you
Ɛda adi sɛ wɔ nnipa a wɔte saa fam no eyi mfa akakabensɛm nkutoo ho na mmom kasadɛ a wɔka no daa a ne ka yɛ mmerɛw te sɛ Mesrɛ wo Manyɛ no yiye Mepa wo kyɛw Meda wo ase Ma mimmue pon no mma wo Tra m’agua yi so Ma mensoa wo nneɛma yi mma wo ’ nso
These and other phrases are like gentle lubricants that smooth out and make pleasant our human relationships
Saa nsɛm yi ne afoforo te sɛ ngo a esiesie yɛne nnipa afoforo ntam abusuabɔ ma ɛyɛ anigye
But showing manners for others the me firster would object would negatively affect my living up to and projecting my image of being number one
Ɔhopɛfo no bɛka sɛ Nanso suban pa a meyi no adi akyerɛ afoforo no mma mintumi nkura nidi a mewɔ sɛ obi a ɔsen afoforo nyinaa no mu na memma no nnya nkɔanim

Sociologist James Q
Asetram nsɛm ho nimdefo James Q
Wilson attributes the increased friction and criminal conduct to the collapse of what today is sneeringly referred to as middle class values and the report continues The demise of these values and the increase in moral relativism appears to correlate with a higher crime rate

It certainly correlates with the modern trend to reject any restraint on self expression regardless of how ill mannered or offensive it may be
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛne nea aba so nnɛ a ɛne pow a wɔpow biribiara a esiw ahohoahoa kwan ɛmfa ho sɛnea ebia ɛmfata anaa ɛhaw adwene no wɔ abusuabɔ
This is as another sociologist Jared Taylor said Our society has moved steadily from self control to self expression and many people dismiss old fashioned values as repressive
Eyi te sɛ nea asetram nsɛm ho nimdefo foforo Jared Taylor kae no Yɛagyae ahosodi mu akɔfa ahohoahoa ntɛm na nnipa pii bɔ tete su horow gu sɛ ɛyɛ katee
Practicing relativism makes you the judge of your personal conduct brushing aside anyone else s judgment including God s
Ankorankoro gyinapɛn a wubenya no ma wubu w’ankasa abrabɔ ho ntɛn na wubu w’ani gu onipa foforo biara atemmu so a Onyankopɔn de ka ho
You are deciding for yourself what is right and what is wrong for you just as the first human pair did in Eden when they rejected God s edict and decided for themselves what was right and what was wrong
W’ankasa wusi nea ɛteɛ anaa nea ɛnteɛ wɔ w’ani so ho gyinae sɛnea nnipa baanu a wodi kan no yɛe wɔ Eden bere a wɔpow Onyankopɔn mmara na wosii nea ɛteɛ ne nea ɛnteɛ ho gyinae maa wɔn ho no ara pɛ
The Serpent deceived Eve into thinking that if she disobeyed God and ate of the forbidden fruit then it would turn out as he said to her Your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God knowing good and bad

So Eve took some of the fruit and ate it and then gave some of it to Adam and he ate it
Enti Hawa tew aduaba no bi dii na ɔmaa Adam bi na odii
Adam and Eve s decision to eat was a disastrous one for them and calamitous for their offspring

After a lengthy summary of corruption found among politicians businessmen athletes scientists a Nobel prize winner and a clergyman one observer said in a speech before the Harvard Business School I believe we are experiencing in our country today what I choose to call a crisis of character a loss of what traditionally through Western civilization had been considered those inner restraints and inner virtues that prevent us from pandering to our own darker instincts

What does all of this have to do with manners ?	Dɛn na eyi nyinaa ne suban pa wɔ yɛ ?
It is about putting yourself first and if you put yourself first you cannot easily give way before others cannot put others first cannot exercise good manners toward others

How does the Bible describe someone who does that ?	Bible ka obi a ɔyɛ saa ho asɛm dɛn ?

The sordid alternative life styles that many people have chosen as morally right for them and the calamitous death dealing consequences of those life styles only prove the truthfulness of Jeremiah I well know O Jehovah that to earthling man his way does not belong
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step

The potential attributes of love wisdom justice and power are still within us but have become unbalanced and distorted
Su atitiriw a ɛne ɔdɔ nyansa atɛntrenee ne tumi no da so wɔ yɛn mu nanso ɛnkari pɛ bio na atɔ kyima
The first step on the way of return is revealed in the last sentence of the Bible text quoted above Keep clear of men like these

Seek out a new environment one that will change even your internal feelings

Instructive toward this end are the wise words written years ago in The Ladies Home Journal by Dorothy Thompson

Her quote opens with the declaration that to overcome juvenile delinquency it is necessary to educate a youth s emotions rather than his intellect 	Nea ɔde fi ne nsɛm no ase ne sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ na wɔatumi adi mmofrabɔnesɛm so no ɛho hia sɛ wɔtete abofra nkate mmom sen sɛ wɔbɛtete n’adwene 
 His actions and attitudes as a child largely determine his actions and attitudes as an adult
Nneyɛe ne suban a ɔda no adi sɛ abofra no ka nneyɛe ne suban a ɔda no adi sɛ ɔpanyin no kɛse
But these are not inspired by his brain but by his feelings
Nanso ɛnyɛ n’adwene na ɛkanyan eyinom na mmom ne nkate
He becomes what he is encouraged and trained to love admire worship cherish and sacrifice for
Ɔbɛyɛ ade a wɔhyɛ no nkuran na wɔtete no ma ɔkyerɛ ho dɔ nya ho anigye ɔsom onya ho anisɔ na ɔde ne ho bɔ afɔre ma no
In all this manners play an important role for good manners are nothing more or less than the expression of consideration for others
Wɔ eyi nyinaa mu no suban pa nya ɔfa a ɛho hia efisɛ nea nneyɛe pa kyerɛ ara ne afoforo ho a wosusuw
Internal feelings are reflected in external behavior but external behavior also contributes to the cultivation of internal feelings
Koma mu nkate da adi wɔ nneyɛe a woyi no adi mu nanso nneyɛe a woyi no adi nso boa ma wonya koma mu nkate
It is hard to feel aggressive while acting considerately
Ɛyɛ den sɛ wubenya atutupɛ su bere a wufi ayamye mu yɛ ade no
Good manners may be only skin deep to start with but they seldom remain so
Ebia mfiase no suban pa no bɛyɛ te sɛ aniani de nanso mpɛn pii no enya nkɔso
She also observed that with rare exceptions goodness and badness are not conditioned by the brain but by the emotions and that criminals become so not from hardening of the arteries but from hardening of the heart
Ɔkae nso sɛ sɛ wɔde tebea mmiako mmiako bi to nkyɛn a ɛnyɛ adwene no na mmom nkate na ɛkanyan papa ne bɔne na ɛnyɛ amumɔyɛfo mogya ntini a ɛyɛ den nti na wonya saa suban no na mmom koma no a ɛyɛ den ntia
She stressed that emotion governs our conduct more often than the mind and that the way we are trained the way we act even if forced at first influences internal feelings and changes the heart
Osii so dua sɛ nkate taa di yɛn suban so kɛse sen adwene no na sɛnea wɔtetee yɛn sɛnea yɛyɛ yɛn ade no sɛ mfiase no yɛhyɛɛ yɛn ho na yɛyɛɛ saa mpo a enya koma mu nkate so tumi ma ɛsakra koma no
However it is the Bible that excels in giving the inspired formula for changing the inner person of the heart
Nanso Bible no na edi mu bere a ɛkyerɛ ɔkwan a efi honhom mu a wɔfa so sakra komam nipa no
First Ephesians You should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires
Nea edi kan no Efesofo Mo kan abrabɔ fam de munyi onipa dedaw a ɔresɛe wɔ nnaadaa akɔnnɔ mu no nkyene
You should be made new in the force actuating your mind and should put on the new personality which was created according to God s will in true righteousness and loyalty
Momma wɔnyɛ mo foforo mo adwene honhom mu na monhyɛ onipa foforo a wɔbɔɔ no Nyankopɔn so nokware trenee ne ahotew mu
Second Colossians Strip off the old personality with its practices and clothe yourselves with the new personality which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it
Nea ɛto so abien Kolosefo Munyi onipa dedaw no ne ne nneyɛe ngu na monhyɛ onipa foforo a wɔyɛ no foforo kɔ nimdeɛ mu nea ɔbɔɔ no no suban so no
Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another
Enti sɛ moyɛ nnipa a Onyankopɔn apaw mo ahotefo ne adɔfo yi monhyɛ ayamhyehye ayamye ahobrɛase adwene odwo abodwokyɛre
Even as Jehovah freely forgave you so do you also
Na sɛ obi ne obi nya asɛm bi a munhuhu mma mo ho na momfa nkyekyɛ mo ho sɛnea Awurade de akyɛ mo no sɛnea mo nso monyɛ ne no
But besides all these things clothe yourselves with love for it is a perfect bond of union
Na eyinom nyinaa so na monhyɛ ɔdɔ a ɛne pɛyɛ hama no ngu
Historian Will Durant said The greatest question of our time is not communism versus individualism not Europe versus America not even the East versus the West it is whether men can live without God

To live a successful life we must heed his counsel
Sɛ yɛn asetra besi yɛn yiye a ɛsɛ sɛ yetie n’afotu
My son my law do not forget and my commandments may your heart observe because length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you
Me ba mma wo werɛ mmfi me mmara na ma wo koma nni me mmara nsɛm so efisɛ onyinkyɛ ne nkwa mfe ne asomdwoe na ɛde bɛka wo ho
May loving kindness and trueness themselves not leave you
Mma adɔe ne nokware nnnyaw wo fa kyekye wo kɔn kyerɛw wo koma pon so
Tie them about your throat
Write them upon the tablet of your heart and so find favor and good insight in the eyes of God and of earthling man
Ɛnna wubenya ɔdom ne nimdeɛ pa Onyankopɔn ne nnipa anim
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding
Fa wo koma nyinaa bata Yehowa ho na mfa wo ho ntweri wo nhumu
In all your ways take notice of him and he himself will make your paths straight
Proverbs
Hu no w’akwan nyinaa mu na ɔno na ɔbɛteɛ w’akwan

The kind and considerate good manners learned by centuries of living are not excess baggage after all and the Bible s guidelines for living are not outmoded at all but will prove to be for mankind s eternal salvation
Suban pa a efi ayamye ne mmɔborohunu mu a wɔasua wɔ asetra mu mfehaha pii no nyɛ adesoa sɛnea ada adi no na asetra ho akwankyerɛ a Bible no de ma no bere ntwaam koraa na mmom ɛbɛkyerɛ daa ogye ama adesamma

Mexico Changes Its Laws on Religion	Mexico Sakra Ne Nyamesom Ho Mmara no
ON JULY THE NEW LAW OF RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND PUBLIC WORSHIP WAS PUT INTO EFFECT IN MEXICO
WƆ JULY NO NYAMESOM AKUW NE BAGUAM ƆSOM HO MMARA FOFORO NO FII ASE YƐƐ ADWUMA WƆ MEXICO
WHY WAS THIS NECESSARY AND WHAT DOES THIS NEW LAW CONVEY ?	DƐN NTI NA EYI HO BEHIAE NA SAA MMARA FOFORO YI FA DƐN HO ?
LET US TAKE A LOOK INTO THIS MATTER THAT HAS AROUSED MUCH ANTICIPATION
MOMMA YƐNHWEHWƐ ASƐM A AMA NKURƆFO REHWƐ NNEƐMA PII KWAN YI MU
WITH Spain s conquest of what is now Mexico the Catholic religion was imposed by force on the people
BERE a Spain dii nea mprempren wɔfrɛ hɔ Mexico so nkonim no wɔde Katolek som no hyɛɛ nkurɔfo no
When the time came to legislate religious matters a law of Spain the Constitucion de Cadiz was applied in part Article stated The religion of the Spanish Nation is and will forever be Catholic Apostolic Roman the one and only true religion
Bere a ɛbere dui sɛ wɔbɛhyɛ nyamesom ho mmara no wɔde Spain mmara bi Constitucion de Cadiz fa bi dii dwuma Mmara a ɛto so no kae sɛ Nea ɛyɛ Ɔman som wɔ Spain na ɛbɛkɔ so ayɛ daa ne Roma Katolek a ɛyɛ Asomafo no nnwuma nsusuwso nokware som biako pɛ a ɛwɔ hɔ no
Later on in a Constitution was established for Mexico and it stated The religion of the Mexican Nation is and will forever be Catholic Apostolic Roman
Akyiri yi wɔ mu no wɔyɛɛ Ɔman Mmara maa Mexico na ɛkae sɛ Nea ɛyɛ Ɔman som wɔ Mexico na ɛbɛkɔ so ayɛ daa ne Roma Katolek a ɛyɛ Asomafo no nnwuma nsusuwso
The Nation protects it by wise and just laws and prohibits the exercise of any other
Ɔman no nam mmara a nyansa wom na ɛteɛ so bɔ ho ban na ɛbara ɔsom foforo biara
Although there were several revisions of the law of the country the same idea was expressed even until granting the Catholic religion priority and in fact excluding any other religion
Ɛwom sɛ wɔyɛɛ nsakrae pii wɔ ɔman no mmara mu de nanso saa adwene no ansesa araa de besi mu mpo na wɔde Katolek som dii kan na nokwarem no wɔamma som afoforo biara ho kwan
It was in that Benito Juarez a Mexican statesman started a revision of the laws of the country introducing what was called Laws of the Reformation
Ɛyɛ mu na Benito Juarez Mexico ɔmanyɛfo bi fii ase yɛɛ nsakrae wɔ ɔman no mmara ahorow mu na nea na wɔfrɛ no Ɔsesɛw Mmara no bae
This was to nationalize the real estate of the church and to increase the political and economic power of the State and to decrease that of the Catholic Church
Na eyi atirimpɔw ne sɛ ɛbɛyɛ asɔre agyapade ɔman de na ama Ɔman no amammui ne sikasɛm so tumi anya nkɔanim ma Katolek Asɔre no de abrɛ ase
Historia de Mexico Volume page In this group of laws of the Law of Nationalization of Ecclesiastical Properties was promulgated as well as a law requiring that marriages be performed by the State in order for them to be legal
Historia de Mexico Po kratafa Wɔyɛɛ Asɔre Agyapade a Wɔdan no Ɔman De ho Mmara no de kaa mmara ahorow yi ho ne afei mmara a na ɛhwehwɛ sɛ Ɔman no ma aware ho kwan ansa na afata wɔ mmara kwan so no
In the Law for Religious Freedom was promulgated
Wɔ mu no wɔyɛɛ Nyamesom Hokwan Mmara no
The reformation laws granted a certain amount of religious freedom to the people stipulating that the Catholic religion would no longer be the only one that could exist in the country
Ɔsesɛw mmara ahorow no maa nkurɔfo hokwan kakra a wɔde bɛpaw ɔsom a wɔn ankasa pɛ na ɛhyɛe sɛ ɛnyɛ Katolek som nkutoo ne ɔsom a ɔman no bɛma ho kwan
However this new freedom was quite limited and conditional
Nanso na hokwan foforo yi nkɔ akyiri pii na na nneɛma bi bata ho
The laws recognized that religions existed in Mexico but did not accord them any legal recognition or rights
Mmara no maa kwan sɛ ɔsom ahorow betumi akɔ so wɔ Mexico de nanso ampene wɔn so anaa amma wɔn hokwan biara wɔ mmara kwan so
Reformation laws were specially designed to limit the Catholic religion but incidentally also limited all religions in the country
Ade titiriw nti a wɔyɛɛ Ɔsesɛw mmara no ne sɛ wɔde bɛbrɛ hokwan a Katolek som no wɔ ase nanso sɛnea ɛkɔyɛe no ɛbrɛɛ hokwan a ɔman no mu som ahorow no nyinaa wɔ no ase
Nevertheless religions apart from Catholicism could then function more freely and Protestant religions from the United States started an evangelization campaign in the country
Nanso saa bere no ɔsom afoforo a ɛnyɛ Katolek som tumi nyaa hokwan yɛɛ adwuma na Protestant som a efi United States no mufo fii asɛmpaka adwuma bi ase wɔ ɔman no mu
The reformation laws were reinforced in with the same anticlerical spirit which caused persecution of the priests and Catholic people
Wɔhyɛɛ ɔsesɛw mmara no mu den wɔ de tiaa asɔfo no bio na ɛde ɔtaa baa asɔfo no ne Katolekfo a wɔaka so
This gave way to the Cristeros war in a Catholic war against the government that was an attempt to cancel the restrictive laws governing religion
Eyi de Cristeros akodi no bae wɔ mu akodi a Katolekfo di tiaa nniso no na ama wɔatwa nyamesom ho mmara katee no mu
This war concluded in with some agreement of tolerance by the government but the laws continued without modification
Ɔko yi baa awiei wɔ mu maa nniso no penee so sɛ wobegyaa nneɛma mu asiesie kakra nanso mmara no kɔɔ so a wɔansakra no
In a commentary about these laws the book Una Ley Para la Libertad Religiosa A Law for Religious Freedom mentions We realize that originally our Constitutional Article in its second paragraph and the other reformed constitutional articles were clearly an infringement of religious freedom since they limited the external practice of every individual s religion and subjected the practice thereof to regulation dictated by the authority
Bere a nhoma a wɔfrɛ no Una Ley Para la Libertad Religiosa Nyamesom Hokwan Mmara Bi reka mmara yi ho asɛm no ɛka sɛ Yɛahu sɛ mfiase no na yɛn Ɔman Mmara a Ɛto so no nkyekyem a ɛto so abien no ne ɔman mmara afoforo a wɔyɛɛ nsakrae wom no tia nyamesom hokwan pefee efisɛ amma ankorankoro biara ansom sɛnea ɔpɛ wɔ baguam na tumidi no na ɛkyerɛɛ ɔkwan a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔfa so
Furthermore these constitutional dispositions were clearly contradictory to what was established in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article and to the American Convention of Human Rights Article which international instruments the Mexican State has endorsed
Afei nso na ɛda adi pefee sɛ saa ɔman mmara ahorow no ne nea Amanaman Nkabom Amansan Mpaemuka a Ɛfa Nnipa Hokwan Ho Mmara a ɛto so ne America Nnipa Hokwan Bagua Mmara a ɛto so a ɛyɛ amanaman ntam nhyehyɛe a Mexico Ɔman no apene so de sii hɔ no bɔ abira
In when the new president of Mexico started his six year term the Catholic hierarchy was invited to the presidential inauguration
Wɔ mu bere a Mexico ɔmampanyin foforo no fii ne mfe asia nniso no ase no wɔtoo nsa frɛɛ Katolek asɔre mpanyimfo sɛ wɔmmra afahyɛ a wɔde besi no mampanyin no bi
In his message President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced the need to modernize the relations between Church and State
Ɔmampanyin Carlos Salinas de Gortari bɔɔ amanneɛ wɔ ne kasa mu sɛ ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ Asɔre ne Ɔman ntam abusuabɔ no foforo
This new approach led to the conclusion that a revision of the laws relative to religion was mandatory
Nneɛma afoforo a wɔyɛe yi kowiee gyinaesi a ɛne sɛ egye ntɛmpɛ sɛ wɔsakra mmara a ɛfa nyamesom ho no
Besides that the country was developing into a more democratic society and negotiations were started for a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada
Afei nso na saa ɔman no redan dodow amammu papa na wofii ase yɛɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ wɔne United States ne Canada bɛyɛ apam abue aguadi hokwan
So it was essential to revise the law to make it consistent with freedom of religion
Enti na ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ nsakrae wɔ mmara no mu sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobenya nyamesom hokwan
The New Law	Mmara No
The new law as stated in its first article is founded on the historic principle of separation of Church and State as well as on freedom of religious beliefs
Sɛnea mmara foforo no ka wɔ ne mmara a edi kan mu no egyina nnyinasosɛm a agye din a ɛne nsonsonoe a wɔma ɛda Asɔre ne Ɔman mu ne nyamesom gyidi hokwan so
The second article guarantees freedom for the individual to have or to adopt the religious beliefs that he prefers and practice collectively or individually the acts of worship or rites of his preference
to profess no religious beliefs
not to be an object of discrimination coercion or hostility because of one s religious beliefs
to associate and meet together peacefully for religious purposes
Mmara a ɛto so abien no ma ankorankoro no hokwan sɛ otumi nya anaa ogye nyamesom gyidi a ɔpɛ tom na ɔne afoforo anaa ne nkutoo yɛ ɔsom mu nneyɛe ne amanneɛ a ɔpɛ

na ɔne afoforo bɔ anaa wohyiam asomdwoe mu ma nyamesom dwumadi ahorow
Through this law churches and religious groups will have legal status as religious institutions as soon as they obtain the corresponding required registry before the Ministry of Government
Esiane saa mmara yi nti sɛ wonya de asɔre ahorow ne nyamesom akuw hyɛ mmara ase wɔ Aban Asoeɛ hɔ a wobegye atom wɔ mmara kwan so sɛ nyamesom ahyehyɛde
Also religious institutions formed according to the present law may have their own patrimony that allows them to fulfill their objective
Afei nso nyamesom ahyehyɛde ahorow a wɔnam mprempren mmara no so tewee no betumi afa wɔn ankasa agyapade a ɛboa wɔn ma wodi wɔn botae ho dwuma
Jehovah s Witnesses Are Registered Legally	Wɔde Yehowa Adansefo Som no Ahyɛ Mmara Ase
In accord with this new law Jehovah s Witnesses in Mexico presented an application to the Office of Religious Affairs on April to be registered as a religion
Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ Mexico gyinaa mmara foforo yi so de akwammisa kratasin kɔmaa Nyamesom ho Nsɛm Adwumayɛbea no April sɛ wɔmfa wɔn nhyɛ mmara ase sɛ nyamesom kuw
Before that time Jehovah s Witnesses as any other religion in the country existed de facto but had no legal personality
Ɛde besi saa bere no na Yehowa Adansefo wɔ ɔman no mu ankasa de nanso te sɛ ɔsom foforo biara no na wonnyee wɔn ntoom wɔ mmara kwan so
Jehovah s Witnesses had been present in the country since early in the th century
Na Yehowa Adansefo ayɛ adwuma wɔ ɔman no mu fi afeha a ɛto so no mfiase
Although there was no legal recognition on June the government of Mexico authorized the International Association of Bible Students
Ɛwom sɛ na wonnyee wɔn ntoom wɔ mmara kwan so de nanso wɔ June no Mexico aban no maa Amanaman Ntam Bible Asuafo Kuw no tumi krataa
On December this name was changed to La Torre del Vigia The Watchtower
Wɔ December no wɔsesaa saa din yi yɛɛ no La Torre del Vigia Ɔwɛn Aban
But in because of laws that limited religious activities in the country a new entity was registered as a civil association
Nanso wɔ mu no esiane mmara ahorow a na ɛmma nyamesom dwumadi hokwan pii wɔ ɔman no mu nti wɔde hyɛɛ mmara ase wɔ din foforo ase sɛ ahyehyɛde a ɛnnyɛ nyamesom de
In this way Jehovah blessed the work that Jehovah s Witnesses had been carrying out throughout the years
Wɔ saa kwan yi so no Yehowa hyiraa adwuma a na Yehowa Adansefo reyɛ no mfe pii no so
At present in accord with a document dated May which was forwarded to them on May Jehovah s Witnesses are registered as La Torre del Vigia A

Their children still have to face pressures in school because of the neutrality issue

The authorities however seek to apply the new law in an equitable way in dealing with the different religions in the country
Nanso atumfoɔ no bɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔde mmara foforo no bedi ama ɔsom ahorow a ɛwɔ ɔman no mu nyinaa a nsisi nnim

Why Is It So Hard to Keep My Mind Off the Opposite Sex ?	Dɛn Nti na Ɛyɛ Den Sɛ Meyi M’adwene Afi Wɔn a Ɛsono Wɔn Bɔbeasu So Saa ?
 Your curiosity about sex is a big thing when you are young explained young Lorraine
Abeawa Lorraine kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ Sɛ wunnyinii a nna ho anigye a wowɔ no hia wo paa
You become more and more preoccupied with sexual matters
Nna ho asɛm kɔ so gye w’adwene pii
DO YOU spend much if not most of your waking hours thinking about talking about or looking at those of the opposite sex ?	SO WODE bere a womfa nyɛ hwee no pii sɛ ɛnyɛ emu fa kɛse a dwennwen wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho ka wɔn ho nsɛm anaa wode hwɛ wɔn ?
Do you sit down to complete your homework only to drift off into a reverie about some nice looking boy or cute girl you saw that afternoon ?

Are your conversations punctuated by furtive glances at attractive passersby ?	Sɛ worebɔ nkɔmmɔ a so wugyae wia w’ani hwɛ nnipa a wɔretwam a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ ?
Is it difficult for you to read study or even concentrate at Christian meetings and conventions simply because you just can t get your mind off the opposite sex ?	So ɛyɛ wo den sɛ wobɛkenkan ade wubesua ade anaa wode w’adwene bedi nsɛm a wɔka wɔ Kristofo nhyiam horow ne nhyiam akɛse ase akyi esiane sɛ wuntumi nyi w’adwene mfi wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu so ara nti ?
If so you may fear that you are going crazy !	Sɛ ɛte saa a ebia wubesuro sɛ gyama biribi reyɛ wo !
One youth confessed I think I might be sex crazy or something

I mean I m so often thinking about girls fantasizing
Mekyerɛ sɛ metaa dwennwen mmeawa ho soso wɔn ho adae
Do you think I m okay ? 	Wususuw sɛ biribiara nhaw me ? 
As writer Lynda Madaras notes when you are young romantic or sexual feelings can be very strong
Sɛnea ɔkyerɛwfo Lynda Madaras kyerɛ no sɛ woyɛ abofra a ɔdɔ anaa nna ho nkate mu betumi ayɛ den kɛse
At times it may even seem as if romance and sex are all you can think about ! 	Ɛtɔ da bi a ebetumi ayɛ wo sɛnea ɔdɔ ne nna ho nkate nkutoo ne ade a wutumi dwennwen ho mpo ! 
 	 
Sexual feelings are not evil in themselves
Nna ho nkate ankasa nyɛ bɔne
God created man and woman with a strong attraction to each other
Onyankopɔn bɔɔ ɔbarima ne ɔbea sɛ wonnya wɔn ho anigye kɛse
This accorded with his purpose that they marry and fill the earth with righteous offspring
Na eyi ne n’atirimpɔw a ɛne sɛ wɔnware nwo atreneefo nhyɛ asase so ma no hyia
The Bible is also quite frank in showing that sexual relations can be a source of great pleasure for married couples
Proverbs
Bible no ka nsɛm pefee de kyerɛ sɛ nna betumi de anigye kɛse abrɛ awarefo
Mmebusɛm
The problem is as imperfect humans we often have difficulty controlling our feelings
Asɛm no ne sɛ sɛ nnipa a yɛtɔ sin no ɛtaa yɛ yɛn den sɛ yebedi yɛn nkate horow so
Compare Genesis
Fa toto Genesis ho
The desire of the flesh can seem overwhelmingly powerful !	 Honam akɔnnɔ betumi ayɛ te sɛ nea emu yɛ den mmoroso !
And because you are young it may be particularly difficult for you to get your mind off the opposite sex
Na esiane sɛ woyɛ abofra nti ebetumi ayɛ den kɛse sɛ wubeyi w’adwene afi wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu so
Why is this ?	Dɛn ntia ?
The Pressures of Puberty	Mpanyin Afe Mu Nhyɛso
One reason is that you are approaching the bloom of youth the time when sexual desires are at their peak
Ade biako nti a ɛte saa ne sɛ worebɛn ɔbaabun bere ɛbere a nna ho akɔnnɔ mu yɛ den sen biara
Explains Dr

Youngs During puberty hormone levels increase dramatically
Youngs kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Wɔ mpanyin afe so no nkwammoaa mu ade bi a wɔfrɛ no hormone no dodow kɔ soro kɛse
These are responsible for setting in motion all the physical changes that transform a child s body into an adult s
Eyinom na ɛma honam fam nsakrae a ɛma abofra nipadua nyin bɛyɛ ɔpanyin de nyinaa ba
The increasing levels of hormones accompanying adolescence bring out many emotional and behavioral changes
Nkwammoaa mu aduru a ɛkɔ soro wɔ mpanyin afe so no de nkate ne nneyɛe fam nsakrae pii ba
What kind of changes ?	Ɛyɛ nsakrae bɛn ?
Well the biggest changes often involve one s feelings toward the opposite sex
Nsakrae akɛse a ɛtaa ba ne nkate a obi nya wɔ wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho
Says writer Ruth Bell The body changes of puberty often bring stronger sexual feelings
Ɔkyerɛwfo Ruth Bell ka sɛ Nipadua mu nsakrae a ɛba wɔ mpanyin afe so no taa de nna ho akɔnnɔ a emu yɛ den ba
You may find yourself thinking more about sex getting sexually aroused more easily even at times feeling preoccupied with sex
Ebia wubehu sɛ wususuw nna ho pii wunya nna ho akɔnnɔ ntɛmntɛm na ɛtɔ da bi mpo a nna gye w’adwene nyinaa
Several teenagers we interviewed described walking down the street or sitting on the bus feeling as if their whole body was on fire with sexual energy and excitement
Mmofra pii a yebisabisaa wɔn nsɛm kae sɛ wotumi te nka te sɛ nea nna ho nkate ne anigye akɛntɛn wɔn nipadua nyinaa so bere a wɔnam abɔnten anaa wɔte bɔs mu no
Such preoccupation with the opposite sex is one of the many desires incidental to youth with which young people must cope
Timothy
Adwene a wɔde si wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu so saa no yɛ mmerante bere mu akɔnnɔ pii a ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra gyina ano no biako
Timoteo
The Influence of the Media and Friends	Nsɛm ho Amanneɛbɔfo ne Nnamfo Nkɛntɛnso
The flame of this desire however is often fanned by outside influences
Nanso mpɛn pii no nkɛntɛnso a atwa yɛn ho ahyia na ɛkanyan saa nkate yi
We live in a society that seems bent on stimulating sexual activity by means of television programs advertising books magazines music and films
Yɛte wiase bi a ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔasi wɔn bo sɛ wɔbɛkanyan nna mu nneyɛe denam television so dwumadi nneɛma ho dawurubɔ nhoma nsɛmma nhoma nnwom ne sini ahorow so mu
Reports one Christian youth who fell into sexual misconduct Pornography is quite common at school and this creates a real craving for sex
Kristoni abofra bi a ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ nna mu ɔbrasɛe mu bɔ amanneɛ sɛ Ɔbrasɛe nhoma abu so kɛse wɔ sukuu mu na eyi kanyan nna ho akɔnnɔ ankasa
I knew what was right but my sexual feelings were strong
Na minim nea eye nanso na nna ho nkate a manya no mu yɛ den
A book written for parents therefore says The media have profound influence
Enti nhoma bi a wɔkyerɛw maa awofo ka sɛ Nsɛm ho amanneɛbɔfo wɔ nkɛntɛnso kɛse
Our teenagers see young models their own age acting sexy and selling sexy clothes they see adolescent sex promoted in the movies and on television
Yɛn mmofra no hu mmofra a wɔne wɔn bɔ tipɛn nhwɛso ahorow sɛ wɔyeyɛ nneɛma a ɛkanyan nna ho akɔnnɔ na wɔtɔn ntade a ɛkanyan nna ho akɔnnɔ wohu sɛ wɔkamfo nna a wɔn a wɔadu mpanyin afe so de wɔn ho behyem wɔ sini ahorow mu ne television so
In fact cable television and videocassette recorders have given many youths easy access to hard core pornography
Nokwarem no television so dwumadi a efi akyirikyiri ne video ahorow ama ayɛ mmerɛw sɛ mmofra pii bɛhwɛ ɔbrasɛe ho nneyɛe pefee
The media arouse the curiosity and desires of a young person admits one youth
Abofra biako gye tom sɛ Nsɛm ho amanneɛbɔfo no kanyan abofra anigye ne n’akɔnnɔ
However a book need not be pornographic on every page to be unwholesome
Nanso ɛho nhia sɛ nhoma bi nkratafa nyinaa ka ɔbrasɛe ho nsɛm ansa na ayɛ nea ɛmfata
Consider the experience of one Christian girl
Susuw Kristoni abeawa bi suahu ho
She recalls I read a rather nice book that had only one or two paragraphs dealing with sex
Ɔka sɛ Mekenkanee nhoma bi a ɛho tew a nkyekyem biako anaa abien pɛ na na ɛfa nna ho
I started to skip over those paragraphs but something made me turn back and read them
Mifii ase bobɔ traa saa nkyekyem no nanso biribi maa mesan m’akyi kɔkenkanee
What a mistake that was !	Hwɛ mfomso ara a na ɛyɛ !
I had terrible dreams as a result
Ɛmaa mesosoo adae basaa
Your friends and associates can also have a big influence on your thinking
Wo nnamfo ne wo mfɛfo nso betumi anya wo nsusuwii so nkɛntɛnso kɛse
One book on adolescent development says Girl and boy watching are common pastimes that take place on street corners in school halls cafeterias and shopping malls
Nhoma bi a ɛfa mmofra nyin ho ka sɛ Mmeawa ne mmarimaa a wɔhwɛ wɔn wɔ mmɔnten ntwea so sukuu asa so adididan mu ne adetɔnbea ahorow yɛ anigyede a abu so
And when young people are not gazing at the opposite sex they are often talking about them
Na sɛ ɛnyɛ sɛ mmofra rehwɛ wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu a mpɛn pii no na wɔreka wɔn ho asɛm
When I was younger admits year old Robert the pressures to have sex were very great
Robert a wadi mfe no gye tom sɛ Bere a na minnyinii pii no mihyiaa nkɛntɛnso kɛse paa a na ɛbɛma mede me ho ahyɛ nna mu
In the locker room that s what all the talk was about
Wɔ dan a yɛhyɛ yɛn ntade wom mu no na ɛno ho asɛm nko ara na wɔka
Admits another youth Sex was the number one topic of conversation among schoolmates so it was often imposed on your thinking
Abofra foforo nso gye tom sɛ Nna ne ade titiriw a na mfɛfo sukuufo bɔ ho nkɔmmɔ enti na wɔtaa de hyɛ w’adwene mu
It is hard to stand out as different
Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛda wo ho adi sɛ woyɛ soronko
When your peers are constantly talking about the opposite sex perhaps in a degrading demoralizing way it can be tempting to join in with them
Sɛ w’atipɛnfo ka wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho asɛm bere nyinaa ebia wɔ ɔkwan a ɛmfra na ɛkanyan ɔbrasɛe ho adwene so a ebetumi adaadaa wo ma wode wo ho abɔ wɔn
But the Bible warns He that is walking with wise persons will become wise but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly
Proverbs
Nanso Bible no bɔ kɔkɔ sɛ Wo ne anyansafo mmɔ na dan onyansafo na nea ɔne nkwasea bɔ no hu amane
Mmebusɛm
The Need for Balance	Hia a Ehia sɛ Wɔkari Pɛ
Does all of this mean it is wrong to notice or want to talk about the opposite sex ?	So eyi nyinaa kyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ w’adwene bɛkɔ wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu so anaa wubenya ɔpɛ sɛ wobɛka wɔn ho asɛm ?
No even Bible writers took note of the fact that certain men and women were physically attractive
Dabi Bible akyerɛwfo mpo kaa nokwasɛm a ɛyɛ sɛ na mmarima ne mmea bi ho yɛ fɛ
Compare Samuel Esther
Fa toto Samuel Ester ho
Jesus therefore did not condemn someone simply for noticing that a woman is attractive
Enti Yesu ammu obi a ohu sɛ ɔbea bi ho yɛ fɛ kɛkɛ no atɛn
But he did exhort Christians not to keep on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her
Nanso otuu Kristofo fo sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔkɔ so hwɛ ɔbea na wonya ne ho akɔnnɔ bi
’
In a similar way you cannot allow yourself to be driven by blind passion
Saa ara na wuntumi mma akɔnnɔ bɔne nnya wo so nkɛntɛnso
At Thessalonians we are told Each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable not in passionate lust like the heathen who do not know God
New International Version
Wɔ Tesalonikafo no wɔka kyerɛ yɛn sɛ Mo mu biara nsua sɛ obedi n’ankasa ne nipadua so ahotew ne nidi mu ɛnyɛ akɔnnɔ anibere mu sɛ wiasefo a wonnim Nyankopɔn no
New International Version
While erotic thoughts may come into the mind from time to time dwelling on them may turn into a near obsession and then serious problems develop
Bere a nna ho akɔnnɔ betumi aba obi tirim bere ne bere mu no sɛ odwennwen ho a ebetumi ahyɛ n’adwene so na afei ɛde ɔhaw akɛse aba
Ecclesiastes says For a dream certainly comes in because of abundance of occupation
Ɔsɛnkafo ka sɛ Na adaeso nam ɔbrɛdwen mu na ɛba
Yes one preoccupied with personal desires often begins nurturing unhealthy fantasies and daydreams
Yiw obi a ɔde n’adwene nyinaa si n’ankasa akɔnnɔ so no taa fi ase nya nsusuwii hunu a ɛmfata na ɔsoso adae
While it is normal to have erotic thoughts from time to time dwelling on them is another matter
Bere a mfomso nni ho sɛ obi benya nna ho adwene bere ne bere mu no gye a ebegye n’adwene nyinaa no yɛ ade foforo
Writer Ruth Bell notes that occasionally a person will find herself or himself spending nearly all day and night in fantasies
Ɔkyerɛwfo Ruth Bell ka sɛ ɛtɔ da bi a obi behu sɛ wanya nsusuwii hunu awia ne anadwo nyinaa
They may come to seem more real than reality
Ebetumi ayɛ sɛ asetram ade bi akyɛn biribi a ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa
Consider one young girl who has got caught up in infatuation
Susuw abeawa ketewa bi a onyaa obi ho akɔnnɔ a ɛmfata ho
She says I m years old and I feel very strongly about a boy who attends my Kingdom Hall
Ɔka sɛ Madi mfe na manya abarimaa bi a me ne no kɔ Ahenni Asa koro so ho anigye kɛse
I know I m not old enough to date but I m having a very hard time controlling my emotions toward him
Minim sɛ minyinii sɛ me ne no befi adi nanso ɛyɛ me den yiye sɛ medi ne ho nkate a manya no so
Along similar lines some youths find it difficult to read study pay attention in class or prepare for Christian meetings when their minds are full of romantic or sexually arousing thoughts
Wɔ akwan a ɛte saa ara so no ɛyɛ mmofra binom den sɛ wɔbɛkenkan ade wobesua ade wɔde wɔn adwene besi nea ɛkɔ so wɔ adesua dan mu so anaa wobesiesie wɔn ho ama Kristofo nhyiam horow bere a nsusuwii a ɛkanyan ɔdɔ ne nna ho akɔnnɔ ayɛ wɔn adwene mu ma no
Serious problems can also result when a youth attempts to alleviate such arousal by masturbation
Ɔhaw akɛse nso betumi afi mu aba bere a abofra bi bɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔnam boasipem so bedwudwo akɔnnɔ a ɛte saa ano no
The Bible urges Christians Deaden therefore your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication uncleanness sexual appetite hurtful desire and covetousness
Bible no hyɛ Kristofo sɛ Enti munkum mo akwaa a ɛwɔ asase so no aguamammɔ afideyɛ akɔnnɔ nhyɛso akɔnnɔ bɔne ne anibere
Masturbation is an unclean habit to be avoided by Christians and is the very opposite of deadening sexual appetite
Boasipem yɛ suban a ɛho ntew a ɛsɛ sɛ Kristofo kwati na ɛne akɔnnɔ nhyɛso a wokum no ’ bɔ abira koraa
On the contrary it stimulates and nurtures it
Mmom no ɛkanyan no na ɛma no yɛ kɛse
All too often such desire becomes reality
Mpɛn pii no akɔnnɔ a ɛte saa no kowie adeyɛ no ankasa mu
The Bible writer James explains Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire
Then the desire when it has become fertile gives birth to sin
James
Bible kyerɛwfo Yakobo kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Wɔsɔ obiara hwɛ a na ɛyɛ n’ankasa akɔnnɔ a egyigye na ɛdaadaa no na ɛsɔ no hwɛ ansa na akɔnnɔ no nyinsɛn a ɛwo bɔne

The lectures on some of these activities include videotapes

Such activities may be compared with the detestable customs that Jehovah hates as enumerated in the Mosaic code at Leviticus chapter

After condemning incestuous acts adultery and other sexual perversions Le verses and state You must not lie down with a male the same as you lie down with a woman
It is a detestable thing

And you must not give your emission to any beast to become unclean by it and a woman should not stand before a beast to have connection with it
It is a violation of what is natural
Wo ne aboa biara nnna mmfa nngu wo ho fi na ɔbea bi nnnyina aboa bi anim nnnan ne ho mmma no ɛyɛ basabasayɛ
The practice of these things that Jehovah detests results in his condemnation Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things because by all these things the nations whom I am sending out from before you have made themselves unclean

 AS A janitorial company we should be ashamed of ourselves but it seems it is cleaner when you people do the cleaning

The man in charge of the janitorial company for the Fukuoka Dome Stadium Japan said this last summer concerning the preparation done by Jehovah s Witnesses for their Divine Teaching District Convention
Adwumayɛkuw a esiesie Fukuoka Dome Agumadibea a ɛwɔ Japan no panyin kaa eyi wɔ ahohuru bere a etwaam no faa ahosiesie a Yehowa Adansefo yɛ maa wɔn Ɔsoro Nkyerɛkyerɛ Ɔmantam Nhyiam no ho
He was also involved with the Tokyo Dome Stadium the preceding year when the Light Bearers District Convention of Jehovah s Witnesses was held there and he was deeply impressed
Na ɔne Tokyo Dome Agumadibea no nso ayɛ adwuma afe a edii eyi anim no bere a wɔyɛɛ Yehowa Adansefo Hann Kurafo Ɔmantam Nhyiam wɔ hɔ no na ne ho dwiriw no kɛse
At the end of the conventions the stadium was cleaner than when it had been rented out
Bere a wowiee nhyiam ahorow no na agumadibea hɔ atew sen sɛnea na ɛte ansa na wɔde hɔ rema wɔn no
He further said The conduct of the children was outstanding

Last year the Divine Teaching District Convention was also held in Takamatsu City
Afe a etwaam no wɔyɛɛ Ɔsoro Nkyerɛkyerɛ Ɔmantam Nhyiam wɔ Takamatsu Kuropɔn mu nso
A middle aged man who had been observing convention delegates asked them Are you Christians ? 	Ɔbarima bi a n’ani afi a na ɔrehwɛ nhyiamfo no bisaa wɔn sɛ Moyɛ Kristofo ? 
and then continued You had a convention last year too didn t you ?	na afei ɔtoaa so sɛ Afe a etwaam no nso moyɛɛ nhyiam ɛnte saa ?
Where are your children during the convention ? 	Sɛ moyɛ nhyiam no a ɛyɛ a mo mma no kɔ he ? 
When the delegates answered They are listening to talks and opening their own Bibles with their parents the man said That s good !	Bere a nhyiamfo no buae sɛ Wɔtra wɔn awofonom nkyɛn tie ɔkasa horow no na wobuebue wɔn ankasa Bible mu no ɔbarima no kae sɛ Saa na eye !
I see your people every summer and am always impressed that your children are well behaved
Mihu mo nkurɔfo no ahohuru bere biara na su pa a mo mma no yi no adi no yɛ me nwonwa bere nyinaa
He then went on to observe that although he hears a lot about the generation gap between parents and children he can tell from the conduct of the children of Jehovah s Witnesses that the parent child relationship among them is very good
Afei ɔkɔɔ so kae sɛ ɛwom sɛ ɔte nkitahodi pa a enni awofo ne wɔn mma ntam ho asɛm de nanso obetumi agyina Yehowa Adansefo mma nneyɛe so aka sɛ awofo ne mma ntam abusuabɔ a wɔwɔ no ye paa
An elementary school teacher who attended a district convention of Jehovah s Witnesses held at Makuhari Messe last year was astounded to see the attitude of the children at the convention site
Mfitiase sukuu tikyani bi a ɔkɔɔ Yehowa Adansefo ɔmantam nhyiam bi a wɔyɛe wɔ Makuhari Messe ase afe a etwaam no ho dwiriw no wɔ mmofra no su a woyii no adi wɔ nhyiambea hɔ no ho
At school where learning should progress by the students listening to others talk she had felt that the children were not willing to listen
Wɔ sukuu a ɛsɛ sɛ sukuufo fa afoforo a wɔyɛ aso tie wɔn bere a wɔkasa so sua ade no na ɔte nka sɛ mmofra no nni ɔpɛ sɛ wɔbɛyɛ aso atie asɛm
However she saw something different at the convention
Nanso ohuu biribi foforo wɔ nhyiam no ase
Those children were sitting up straight for long periods of time
Saa mmofra no traa ase komm bere tenten
And what is more they were holding their pencils tight in their hands and taking notes writing characters correctly despite having to write on their laps
Nea ɛsen saa no na wokurakura wɔn kyerɛwdua denneenen a wɔrekyerɛkyerɛw nsɛm na wotumi kyerɛw nkyerɛwde no yiye ɛmfa ho sɛ na wɔrekyerɛw wɔ wɔn srɛ so no
The Witness children are different from other children even at school in their way of speaking and listening and in their dress and grooming
Wɔ sukuu mpo no Adansefo mmofra no yɛ soronko wɔ mmofra afoforo ho wɔ ɔkwan a wɔfa so kasa na wotie asɛm ne wɔn ntadehyɛ ne ahosiesie mu
She then added I think it is because of their daily training their praising Jehovah and their families working together toward one end
Afei ɔde kaa ho sɛ Misusuw sɛ efi ntetee a wɔde ma wɔn daa Yehowa a woyi no ayɛ ne wɔn mmusua a wɔbom yɛ nneɛma wɔ atirimpɔw biako mu no
Just as the Israelites followed the divine law that said Congregate the people the men and the women and the little ones
in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn Jehovah s Witnesses today both old and young men and women gather together and receive the same teaching
Sɛnea Israelfo no dii ɔsoro mmara a ɛkae sɛ Ma ɔman no mmarima ne mmea mmofra
mmɔ gua na wontie na wonsua akyi no Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ hɔ nnɛ mpanyin ne mmofra nyinaa mmarima ne mmea bom hyia na wonya nkyerɛkyerɛ biako
The above scripture continues giving the reason As they must fear Jehovah your God and take care to carry out all the words of this law
Deuteronomy

How Can I Get My Mind off the Opposite Sex ?	Mɛyɛ Dɛn Ayi M’adwene Afi Wɔn a Ɛsono Wɔn Bɔbeasu So ?
 DAY after day the media chips away at teenagers moral fiber with taunts and teases about sex rock songs screech in their ears about sexual relationships a barrage of best selling romance novels wrap sexual reality in fantasies sweet enough to swallow like candy
DA BIARA da nsɛm ho amanneɛbɔfo de mpoatwa ne nsɛm a ɛtwetwe akɔnnɔ sɛe mmofra abrabɔ rock nnwom de nna mu ayɔnkofa ho nsɛm tuatua wɔn aso ɔdɔ ho nhoma a wɔtɔ sen biara huhaa a egyigye nna mu nneyɛe ho ma ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ ɛwo
’
So said writer Lesley Jane Nonkin
Saa na nhoma kyerɛwfo Lesley Jane Nonkin kae
Yes as a teenager you are bombarded with encouragement from the media to think about the opposite sex
Yiw sɛ abofra no nsɛm ho amanneɛbɔfo de nkuranhyɛ a ɛbɛma woadwen wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho puapua wo
Of course it is normal to have some interest in the opposite sex
Nokwarem no mfomso nni ho sɛ wubenya wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho anigye bi
But when romantic thoughts daydreams and fantasies so dominate your thoughts that they interfere with your sleep prayers homework Bible reading or household chores then it indicates that the situation has been dangerous for some time
Nanso sɛ ɔdɔ ho nsusuwii adaeso ne nsusuwii hunu gye w’adwene nyinaa ma wuntumi nna mmɔ mpae nyɛ sukuu nnwuma nkenkan Bible anaa wuntumi nyɛ fie nnwuma a ɛnde na ɛkyerɛ sɛ tebea no ayɛ aniberesɛm akyɛ
Indeed such an unhealthy preoccupation could lead to wrong conduct
James

Yakobo
Not that you should stop noticing that girls or boys exist

But as Proverbs says you need to bring your heart to discipline

No there is no easy solution no magic pill to help you do this
Dabi ano aduru biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na biribiara ntumi mmoa wo mma wunni eyi ho dwuma anwonwa kwan so
With effort though you can bring your thinking more into balance
Nanso sɛ wobɔ wo ho mmɔden a wubetumi ama wo nsusuwii akari pɛ kɛse
Let s look at a few practical ways you can do this
Yɛnhwɛ akwan a mfaso wɔ so a wubetumi afa so ayɛ eyi kakra
Watch the Company You Keep	Hwɛ Wo Fekubɔ Yiye
Take a close look at the company you keep
Fa ahwɛyiye pɛɛpɛɛ wo fekubɔ mu
Admits one young man Everybody around you talks about sexual immorality as if it were as normal as going out to eat
Aberante bi gye tom sɛ Obiara a ɔwɔ wo nkyɛn no ka nna mu ɔbrasɛe ho asɛm sɛ biribi a asɛm nni ho te sɛ adidi
Can constant exposure to such talk affect you ?	So nkɔmmɔ a ɛtete saa a wubetie no daa no betumi anya wo so tumi ?
Undoubtedly
Akyinnye biara nni ho
According to one survey of youths three quarters admitted that being like or unlike the crowd governs their attitudes toward sex
Sɛnea nhwehwɛmu biako a wɔyɛe wɔ mmofra ho kyerɛ no wɔn mu baanan biara mu baasa gye toom sɛ nna ho adwene a wokura no gyina yɛ a wɔyɛ wɔn ade anaa wɔnyɛ no te sɛ afoforo so
What about your friends ?	Wo nnamfo nso ɛ ?
Does every conversation lapse into an intense discussion about someone of the opposite sex ?	So wɔn nkɔmmɔbɔ biara kowie obi a ɛsono ne bɔbeasu ho nsɛm a ɛkɔ akyiri mu ?
Does such talk tend to get out of hand and become lewd or suggestive ?	So ɛyɛ a nkɔmmɔbɔ a ɛte saa no dan kɔ kasafi so anaa ɛkanyan akɔnnɔ bɔne ?
If so joining in or simply listening will make it difficult for you to keep your mind focused on chaste things
Sɛ ɛte saa a kyɛfa a wubenya wom anaa tie a wubetie kɛkɛ no bɛma ayɛ wo den sɛ wobɛkɔ so de w’adwene asi nneɛma pa so
The Bible exhorts Put them all away from you wrath anger badness abusive speech and obscene talk out of your mouth
Colossians
Bible no tu fo sɛ Munyi abufuw bobɔne bɔnepɛ abususɛm ne aniwusɛm nyinaa mfi mo anom ngu
Kolosefo
It will be hard to apply this counsel however if your companions have little appreciation for Bible principles their attitudes are sure to rub off on you in time
Nanso ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wode afotu yi bedi dwuma sɛ wo nnamfo nkyerɛ Bible nnyinasosɛm ahorow ho anisɔ kɛse a akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ bere rekɔ so no wɔn su horow no bɛka wo
Consider the experience of one Christian girl who said I didn t want to tell the kids in school that I was one of Jehovah s Witnesses
Susuw Kristoni abeawa bi a ɔkaa eyi no suahu ho Mampɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ sukuu hɔ mmofra no sɛ meyɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako
So they talked freely to me about sex all the time
Enti wɔkaa nna ho nsɛm pii kyerɛɛ me bere nyinaa
Before long she became involved in sexual immorality and got pregnant
Ankyɛ na ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ nna mu ɔbrasɛe mu nyinsɛnee
Proverbs wisely exhorts Leave the company of ignorant people and live
Follow the way of knowledge
Mmebusɛm fi nyansam tu fo sɛ Munnyaw ntetekwaa na munnya nkwa na monnantew nhumu kwan so
Today s English Version Yes surround yourself with friends who share your Christian morals and standards friends who will build you up spiritually not tear you down
Yiw wo ne nnamfo a wokura wo Kristofo abrabɔ ne gyinapɛn ahorow mu bi mmɔ nnamfo a wɔbɛhyɛ wo den honhom mu ɛnyɛ wɔn a wɔbɛma woahwe ase
Of course even young Christians who generally show a godly attitude may stumble in word from time to time
Nokwarem no Kristofo nkumaa a wɔtaa da su pa adi mpo betumi afom asɛm mu ’ bere ne bere mu
When that happens and a conversation starts going in the wrong direction what can you do ?	Sɛ ɛba saa ma nkɔmmɔbɔ bi fi ase tɔ kɔ nneɛma a ɛmfata so a dɛn na wubetumi ayɛ ?
The Bible tells us that King Solomon became infatuated with a young shepherd girl
Bible no ka kyerɛ yɛn sɛ Ɔhene Salomo benyaa abeawa guanhwɛfo bi ho anigye
She however did not return the romantic interest
Nanso abeawa no de wankyerɛ ne ho anigye
When some young companions tried to arouse her feelings for Solomon she did not allow herself to be bombarded with romantic talk
Bere a ne mfɛfo nkumaa bi bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkanyan no ma wanya Salomo ho akɔnnɔ no wamma wɔamfa ɔdɔ ho nsɛm ampuapua no
She spoke up saying I have put you under oath
that you try not to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined
Obuee n’ano kasae na ɔkae sɛ Meka mo ntam
sɛ munnnyan na monnhwanyan ɔdɔ kosi sɛ ɔno ara pɛ
In a similar way you may need to speak up when talk gets out of hand
Ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so no ebia ɛho behia sɛ wubue w’ano kasa bere a nkɔmmɔbɔ bi dan kɔ nneɛma a ɛmfata so no
No you do not necessarily have to lecture your friends
Dabi ɛho nhia ankasa sɛ wobɛka nsɛm pii akyerɛ wo nnamfo no
But you might try simply changing the subject steering the conversation in a more wholesome direction
Nanso nea wubetumi ayɛ ara ne sɛ wobɛbɔ mmɔden asakra nea moreka ho asɛm no adan nkɔmmɔbɔ no akɔ biribi a ɛfata so
Entertainment The Need to Be Selective	Anigyede Nyiyim ho Hia
Another area of concern is entertainment
Ade foforo a ehia sɛ ani ku ho ne anigyede
The latest movie video or disc may look appealing
Ebetumi ayɛ te sɛ nea sini video anaa mpaawa a aba so foforo kanyan anigye
However the Bible reminds us Everything in the world the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one s means of life does not originate with the Father but originates with the world
Nanso Bible no kae yɛn sɛ Nea ɛwɔ wiase nyinaa honam akɔnnɔ ne aniwa akɔnnɔ ne asetra mu ahohoahoa emfi agya no na mmom efi wiase
As mentioned at the outset much of today s entertainment is designed to arouse sexual feelings
Sɛnea wɔaka wɔ mfiase no wɔayɛ nnɛ anigyede no pii ma akanyan nna ho nkate
Popular songs and films for example have become increasingly explicit often pornographic
Sɛ nhwɛso no nnwom ne sini ahorow a agye din no abɛyɛ nea ɛda nneɛma adi pefee ankasa mpɛn pii no ɛfa ɔbrasɛe ho
How might it affect you to expose yourself to such entertainment ?	Sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ anigyede a ɛte saa mu a ebetumi aka wo dɛn ?
Says writer John Langone A number of studies have shown
that when we are exposed to erotic material we tend to talk more about sex
Nhoma kyerɛwfo John Langone ka sɛ Nhwehwɛmu dodow bi akyerɛ sɛ
sɛ yehu nneɛma a ɛkanyan nna ho akɔnnɔ a ɛma yɛka nna ho asɛm kɛse
Sometimes this exposure leads us to try things we wouldn t ordinarily try
Ɛtɔ da bi a nneɛma a ɛte saa a yehu no ma yɛsɔ nneɛma bi a anka yɛrensɔ nhwɛ no hwɛ
Yes setting your mind on the things of the flesh will only harm you
Yiw ɔhonam nneɛma ho a wubedwen ’ no bepira wo mmom
It will distort your view of love and sex and fill your mind with unclean fantasies
Ɛbɛsɛe nna ne ɔdɔ ho adwene a wowɔ na ɛde nsusuwii hunu a ɛho ntew ahyɛ w’adwene mu
The Bible s counsel ?	Afotu bɛn na Bible de ma ?
 Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in God s fear
Momma yɛnhohoro yɛn ho mfi ɔhonam ne honhom mu fi nyinaa mu na yɛawie yɛn ahotew Onyankopɔn suro mu
So steer clear of films videos and discs that stimulate romantic desire
Enti twe wo ho fi sini video ne mpaawa a ɛkanyan nna ho akɔnnɔ ho
A single Christian man once gave this bit of practical advice Don t feast on unwholesome things just before going to bed
Bere bi Kristoni barima sigyani bi de afotu tiawa a mfaso wɔ so yi mae Sɛ worebɛda a mfa nneɛma a ɛmfata nhyɛ w’adwene mu
Many late night TV shows are quite suggestive
Nneɛma a woyi wɔ TV so ɔdasum no pii kanyan akɔnnɔ bɔne kɛse
So are many books
Saa ara nso na nhoma pii te
Confesses a young Christian named Sherry I used to read romance novels
Kristoni kumaa bi a wɔfrɛ no Sherry gye tom sɛ Na mekenkan ɔdɔ ho nhoma
I would fantasize about sex dreaming about the high life and bed hopping
Na misusuw nna ho soso asetra a ɛyɛ anigye ne mpenafo pii a wonya ho adae
Her mind full of romantic fantasies she easily fell into necking and petting with a young man
Bere a nna ho nsusuwii hunu yɛɛ n’adwene mu ma no ɔne aberante bi sosoo wɔn ho mu
Problems like that can be avoided if you stick to wholesome reading material like this journal and its companion The Watchtower
Wubetumi akwati nsɛnnennen a ɛte saa bere a wokenkan nhoma a ɛfata nkutoo no ebi ne nsɛmma nhoma yi ne nea ɛka ho Ɔwɛn Aban
Such reading has helped many youths to set their minds on the things of the spirit instead of on the fallen flesh
Romans

Get Rid of Those Fantasies !	Yi Saa Nsusuwii Hunu no Fi W’adwene Mu !
At times thoughts about the opposite sex may just pop into your mind without warning
Ɛtɔ da bi a wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho adwene betumi aba wo tirim prɛko pɛ a wonhwɛ kwan
Confesses year old Scott There are times when it becomes very difficult for me to keep my mind off sex
Scott a wadi mfe gye tom sɛ Ɛtɔ mmere bi a ɛyɛ den ma me yiye sɛ meyi m’adwene afi nna so
Or perhaps you simply see a good looking boy or girl
Anaasɛ ebia wuhu abarimaa anaa abeawa bi a ne ho yɛ fɛ kɛkɛ
Before you realize it you find yourself thinking about him or her
W’adwene bɛba wo ho so no na woresusuw ne ho
But it is one thing to notice that someone is attractive and a different thing entirely to do what Jesus warned against namely to keep on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her
Nanso nsonsonoe kɛse da hu a wubehu sɛ obi ho yɛ fɛ ne yɛ a wobɛyɛ nea Yesu bɔɔ kɔkɔ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ a ɛne sɛ wobɛkɔ so ahwɛ ɔbea na wo kɔn adɔ no ’ no ntam
When you are too young to marry wallowing in tantalizing romantic fantasies can only depress and discourage you
Compare Proverbs
Sɛ wunnyinii pii sɛ wobɛware a nna ho nsusuwii hunu a emu yɛ den a wobɛma agye w’adwene no bɛma woabotow na abu w’abam kɛkɛ
Fa toto Mmebusɛm ho
Scott thus says What helps me is to change the subject get my mind off the thoughts that cause me to feel excited
Enti Scott ka sɛ Nea ɛboa me ne sɛ mɛsesa me nsusuwii meyi m’adwene afi nsusuwii a ɛma minya akɔnnɔ no so
I remind myself that the feelings or urges will go away in time
Mekae me ho sɛ bere bi akyi no saa nkate ne akɔnnɔ no befi hɔ
Compare Philippians
Fa toto Filipifo ho
The apostle Paul said I pummel my body and lead it as a slave
Ɔsomafo Paulo kae sɛ Mehyɛ me nipadua ahometew na midi no nya
Similarly you may have to get tough with yourself when thoughts about the opposite sex try to take root
Saa ara na ebia ɛho behia sɛ wohyɛ wo ho so bere a wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu ho adwene reyɛ adi wo so no
If the thoughts persist try some physical exercise
Sɛ adwene no amfi so a pɛ ahoɔden nnwuma bi yɛ
Bodily training is beneficial for a little and a brisk walk or a few minutes of calisthenics may be all you need to help you get your mind back on track
Timothy

Many youths have also found that having plenty to do in the work of the Lord is particularly helpful

Getting thoroughly involved with the Christian congregation and all its activities can do much to help you keep your thinking in balance

When I feel sexual urges coming on says one single Christian man I really make myself pray

States the Bible Let us therefore approach with freeness of speech to the throne of undeserved kindness that we may obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time
Bible no ka sɛ Enti momma yɛmfa nnam mmra ɔdom ahengua no anim na yɛanya mmɔborohunu na yɛahu ɔdom na ɛbere a ɛsɛ mu aboa yɛn
No God will not take away your interest in the opposite sex

A third reason supplementary education may be needed is that in numerous lands there is a surplus of college graduates flooding the job market
Nea ɛto so abiɛsa a enti ebia nhomasua ntoaso behia ne sɛ wɔn a wɔawie kɔlege a wonnya adwuma nyɛ no abu so wɔ aman pii mu
College graduates outstrip the demand for their skills says The New York Times

In the United States percent continue their education beyond high school

This represents a significant increase over the percent figure that lingered for decades

Similar trends are noted in other countries as well

In some cases the minimum schooling required by law is not enough

Of course no form of schooling including college or any other supplementary education provides a guarantee of success
Nokwarem no nhomasua biara a sukuupɔn anaa nhomasua biara a wɔtoa so ka ho rentumi nkyerɛ sɛ wubedi yiye
Moreover the Bible accurately notes that the scene of this world is changing
Bio nso Bible no ka no nokwarem sɛ wi yi ase su retwam
What is in demand today may be worthless tomorrow
Ebia nea wɔhwehwɛ nnɛ bɛyɛ nea mfaso nni so ɔkyena
Thus a person considering supplementary education would do well to weigh carefully the pros and cons
Enti ɛsɛ sɛ obi a ɔresusuw ho sɛ ɔbɛtoa ne nhomasua so no kari emu mfaso ne huammɔdi hwɛ yiye
Can I afford the cost ?	 So metumi atua ho ka ?
What type of environment and associates would I be exposed to ?	Tebea ne ayɔnkofo bɛn na mehyia ?
Would the courses impart practical training that would enable me to support myself ?	So adesua no bɛma manya ntetee a wotumi de yɛ adwuma a ebetumi ama mahwɛ me ho ?
Would it help me to provide for a family if I eventually get married ? 	So ɛbɛboa me ma mahwɛ m’abusua sɛ awiei koraa no meware a ? ’
Supportive parents may be able to provide valuable counsel in line with the responsibility that the Bible places on them
Awofo a wɔyɛ mmoa betumi de afotu pa ama ma ɛne asɛyɛde a Bible de to wɔn so no ahyia
If you are considering the financial benefits of supplementary education or any other aspect of it Jesus words are appropriate Who of you that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it ? Luke
Sɛ woresusuw sika fam mfaso horow a ɛwɔ nhomasua a wɔtoa so anaa ne fa biara so ho a Yesu nsɛm yi ho hia Mo mu hena na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔto abantenten na ɔrentra ase mmu ho akontaa ansa sɛ ɔwɔ nea ɔde betumi awie ? Luka
Indeed whether to pursue supplementary education is a decision that should be weighed carefully
Nokwarem no sɛ ebia obi bɛtoa ne nhomasua so no yɛ gyinaesi a ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw ho yiye
A Christian always bears in mind Jesus words at Matthew Keep on then seeking first the kingdom and your heavenly Father s righteousness and all these other things will be added to you
Kristoni ma Yesu nsɛm a ɛwɔ Mateo yi tra n’adwenem bere nyinaa Monhwehwɛ mo soro Agya no ahenni ne ne trenee kan na wɔde eyinom nyinaa bɛka mo ho
Among genuine Christians those without additional education are not looked down upon or treated as inferior nor are those with extended education ostracized or dismissed as high minded
Wɔ nokware Kristofo mu no wommu wɔn a wɔantoa wɔn nhomasua so no animtiaa anaasɛ wommu wɔn sɛ wɔba fam na saa ara na wɔntwe wɔn ho mfi wɔn a wɔasua ade akɔ akyiri no ho na wommu wɔn sɛ wobu wɔn ho dodo
The apostle Paul wrote Who are you to judge the house servant of another ?	Ɔsomafo Paulo kyerɛwee sɛ Hena ne wo a wubu obi fienipa atɛn ?
To his own master he stands or falls
Indeed he will be made to stand for Jehovah can make him stand
Romans

Jesus reflected this balanced view
Yesu daa adwene a ɛkari pɛ yi adi
He did not despise those who were unlettered and ordinary nor did he hold back from selecting well educated Paul to accomplish a powerful evangelizing work

Supplementary Education	Nhomasua a Wɔtoa So
The Watchtower of November noted concerning Jehovah s Witnesses and the full time ministry The general trend in many lands is that the level of schooling required to earn decent wages is now higher than it was a few years ago

It is difficult to find jobs with decent wages after completing simply the minimum schooling required by law
Ayɛ den sɛ wobenya nnwuma a akatua no ye bere a wɔawie mfitiase sukuu a mmara hwehwɛ no
What is meant by decent wages ?
Sɛ wɔka akatua a eye ’ a dɛn na ɛkyerɛ ?
Their wages might be termed adequate or satisfactory if what they earn allows them to live decently while leaving them sufficient time and strength to accomplish their Christian ministry

It is much the same with our priorities in life

Yesu Kristo kae sɛ Anigye ne wɔn a wɔn honhom fam nneɛma ho hia wɔn na wɔn na ɔsoro ahenni no yɛ wɔn dea
Thus spiritual values should be right up front

In contrast material possessions should be of less significance

It is certainly not an insignificant detail to a Christian
Ɛda adi sɛ Kristoni bu no sɛ ɛho hia
Some amount of secular education is usually necessary to fulfill the Scriptural obligation given by the apostle Paul If anyone does not provide for those who are his own and especially for those who are members of his household he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith
Wiase no nhomasua bi ho taa hia na yɛadi Kyerɛwnsɛm mu asɛyɛde a ɔsomafo Paulo de mae no ho dwuma Na sɛ obi nhwɛ n’ankasa ne nnipa ne ne titiriw no ne fifo a wapa gyidi na ɔyɛ onipa bɔne sen nea onnye nni
Furthermore the commission Jesus gave his followers to make disciples teaching them to observe all the things he commanded requires that one take in knowledge and then effectively instruct others
Matthew John Acts Timothy
Afei nso adwuma a Yesu de maa n’akyidifo sɛ wɔnyɛ asuafo na wɔnkyerɛkyerɛ wɔn sɛ wonni nea wahyɛ nyinaa so ’ no hwehwɛ sɛ obi nya nimdeɛ ’ na afei ɔkyerɛkyerɛ afoforo wɔ ɔkwan a etu mpɔn so
Mateo Yohane Asomafo no Nnwuma Timoteo
Yet education must be kept in its place
Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɔma nhomasua tra n’afa
It should not be pursued merely for the sake of shining scholastically or acquiring impressive degrees
Ɛnsɛ sɛ obi de ne ho hyem a n’atirimpɔw ne sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nhomanimfo kɛse anaasɛ obenya nhomasua adanse nkrataa a wobu no kɛse kɛkɛ
Giving the pursuit of education undue prominence is self defeating
Nhomasua a obi ma ɛho hia no dodo no de abasamtu ba
Granted it may provide some temporary material benefits
Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ ebetumi ama woanya bere tiaa mu honam fam mfaso bi de
But as wise King Solomon observed You work for something with all your wisdom knowledge and skill and then you have to leave it all to someone who hasn t had to work for it

Ɔsɛnkafo Today’s English Version
Jehovah s Witnesses are interested in education not for its own sake but to enhance their usefulness in God s service and to support themselves
Yehowa Adansefo ani gye nhomasua ho nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn atirimpɔw ne sɛ wobesua nhoma kɛkɛ na mmom sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ na wɔn ho aba mfaso kɛse wɔ Onyankopɔn adwuma mu na wɔatumi ahwɛ wɔn ho
Since their ministry is a nonprofit work many have to rely on secular employment to make a living
Esiane sɛ wɔmfa wɔn som adwuma no mpɛ mfaso nti wɔn mu pii yɛ honam fam adwuma na ama wɔanya nea wɔde hwɛ wɔn ho
This can be especially challenging for full time ministers of Jehovah s Witnesses called pioneers
Eyi betumi ayɛ asɛnnennen ama Yehowa Adansefo bere nyinaa asomfo a wɔfrɛ wɔn akwampaefo no titiriw
They must maintain an intensified schedule in the ministry while making adequate provision for themselves and their families if married
Ɛsɛ sɛ wodi ɔsom adwuma no ho bere nhyehyɛe a ɛsodi nyɛ mmerɛw so na sɛ wɔaware a wɔyɛ nsiesiei a ɛfata ma wɔne wɔn mmusua

After weighing the various factors involved some of Jehovah s Witnesses have chosen to undertake supplementary education
Bere a Yehowa Adansefo binom susuw ɛho nsɛm ahorow ho no wɔpawee sɛ wɔbɛtoa wɔn nhomasua so
Of course they have had to exercise caution in order to keep education in its place
Nokwarem no na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhwɛ yiye na wɔama nhomasua atra n’afa
What has aided them in doing this ?	Dɛn na aboa wɔn ma wɔayɛ eyi ?
 Several factors helped me says a young Brazilian named John
Brazilni abofra bi a wɔfrɛ no John ka sɛ Nneɛma pii na ɛboaa me
Even when I had to study at night I did not miss Christian meetings
Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ misua ade anadwo mpo a mamma Kristofo nhyiam ampa me ti so
I also made it clear to my classmates from the start that I was one of Jehovah s Witnesses
Meka kyerɛɛ me mfɛfo sukuufo nso pefee fi mfiase sɛ meyɛ Yehowa Dansefo
Eric also from Brazil took advantage of opportunities to talk to others about his beliefs while extending his education
Eric a ɔno nso fi Brazil de hokwan ahorow kaa ne gyidi ho asɛm kyerɛɛ afoforo bere a na ɔretoa ne nhomasua so no
I considered the school my special territory he says
Ɔka sɛ Mibuu me sukuu mu sɛ m’asasesin titiriw
I was able to conduct Bible studies with several teachers and students five of whom are now baptized two of them serving as elders

Richard went back to school part time to receive a degree in drafting
Richard nso san de ne bere fa kɔɔ sukuu konyaa sɛnea wɔyɛ ɔdan nsusuwso ho adansedi krataa
My schooling helped me to find work to support myself and my wife he says but it also opened a door of opportunity
Ɔka sɛ Sukuu a mekɔe no boaa me ma minyaa adwuma a mede bɛhwɛ me ho ne me yere na abue hokwan bi nso ama me
As I traveled to quickly built Kingdom Hall construction projects and spoke to those in charge I learned that there was a need for draftsmen
Bere a mekɔɔ Ahenni Asa a wosisi no ahoɔhare so nnwumayɛbea na me ne ɛso ahwɛfo bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ no mihui sɛ wohia wɔn a wonim sɛnea wɔyɛ adan nsusuwso
My education is now being put to good use in these projects
Mprempren mede me nhomasua no redi dwuma pa wɔ nnwuma yi mu
Additionally my wife and I hope eventually to serve either at the world headquarters or on the international construction projects of Jehovah s Witnesses

At the same time many of Jehovah s Witnesses have met the challenge of providing for themselves and their families without extra schooling
Bere koro no ara mu no Yehowa Adansefo pii atumi adi adwumaden a ɛne sɛ wɔbɛhwɛ wɔn ho ne wɔn mmusua a wɔantoa wɔn nhomasua so
I support myself by doing housework two days a week explains Mary
Mary kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Mede nnanu siesie nkurɔfo afie mu dapɛn biara de hwɛ me ho
Ironically I make more money per hour than some of the people I work for
Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ne sɛ dɔnhwerew biara minya sika pii sen nnipa a meyɛ adwuma ma wɔn mo mu binom
But I view my work as a means to an end
Nanso mibu m’adwuma no sɛ nea ɛma minya sika hwɛ me ho kɛkɛ
It keeps me in the pioneer work and I have no regrets
Ɛma mitumi kɔ so yɛ akwampae adwuma no na minnuu me ho
Steve feels similarly
Steve te nka saa ara
When I began pioneering he says some said to me What are you going to do if you get married and have a family ?	Ɔka sɛ Bere a mifii akwampae adwuma ase no ebinom bisaa me sɛ Sɛ woware na wunya abusua a dɛn na wobɛyɛ ?
Will you be able to make ends meet ? 	So mubetumi anya sika a ɛdɔɔso ahwɛ mo ho ? ’
As it turns out I ve done so many different kinds of work that I ve got experience in just about everything you can imagine
Sɛnea ɛbɛdaa adi no mayɛ nnwuma ahorow pii araa ma manya adwuma pii a wubetumi asusuw ho mu suahu
Now that I have a wife to support I find that I am making more than some college graduates who work at our agency
Mprempren mewɔ yere a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no na migye akatua a ɛso sen wɔn a wɔawie sukuupɔn a wɔwɔ yɛn adwumam no mu binom
Unbelieving fathers may have required minor children to take on supplementary education and they have Scriptural authority to do this
Agyanom a wonnye nni betumi aka sɛ wɔn mma nkumaa ntoa wɔn nhomasua so na Kyerɛwnsɛm no ma wɔn kwan sɛ wotumi yɛ eyi
However in such cases and in line with Matthew youths may take on courses that will help them to become more useful in Jehovah s service or even allow them to engage in the full time ministry at the same time as attending a school
Nanso wɔ nsɛm a ɛte sɛɛ mu no mmofra betumi asua nneɛma a ɛbɛboa wɔn ma wɔn ho aba mfaso kɛse wɔ Yehowa adwuma mu anaasɛ ɛbɛma wɔn kwan mpo ma wɔayɛ bere nyinaa som adwuma no bere a wɔrekɔ sukuu no ma ɛne Mateo ahyia
The Greatest Education	Nhomasua a Ɛsen Biara
All of Jehovah s Witnesses regardless of their educational status have something in common
Ade biako bi wɔ hɔ a Yehowa Adansefo nyinaa nim a ɛmfa ho sɛnea wɔn mu biara nhomasua gyinapɛn te
They recognize that the most important education available today has its source in God s Word the Bible
Wonim sɛ nhomasua a ɛho hia sen biara nnɛ no gyina Onyankopɔn Asɛm Bible no so
John says This means everlasting life their taking in knowledge of you the only true God and of the one whom you sent forth Jesus Christ
Yohane NW ka sɛ Na eyi kyerɛ daa nkwa sɛ wobenya wo nokware Nyankopɔn koro no ne nea wosomaa no Yesu Kristo ho nimdeɛ
No matter what secular education a Christian obtains taking in knowledge of Jehovah and his Son Jesus must be a priority
Nhomasua ko a Kristoni nsa ka no mfa ho ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde Yehowa ne ne Ba Yesu ho nimdeɛ a obenya no di kan
This pattern was set by first century Christians
Afeha a edi kan no mu Kristofo yɛɛ saa nhwɛso yi
Manaen was educated with Herod the district ruler yet he was present and active among the prophets and teachers of the Antioch congregation
Wɔyɛn Manaen ne ɔmansinhene Herode faako ’ nanso na ɔka Antiokia asafo no mu adiyifo ne akyerɛkyerɛfo ho na na ɔyɛ nnam
Similarly Paul received what today would be comparable to a university education
Saa ara nso na Paulo nyaa nhomasua a ɛte sɛ nnɛ sukuupɔn mu nhomasua
Nevertheless after becoming a Christian he kept his training in its place
Nanso ɔbɛyɛɛ Kristoni akyi no ɔmaa ne ntetee no traa n’afa
Rather than using it to overawe others he used his knowledge of sociology law and history to preach to people of all sorts
Acts Corinthians Philippians
Sɛ anka ɔde bedi dwuma ma afoforo asuro no no ɔde asetra mmara ne abakɔsɛm ho nimdeɛ a na ɔwɔ no kaa asɛm kyerɛɛ nnipa ahorow pii
Asomafo no Nnwuma Korintofo Filipifo
First century Christians were not known primarily for their educational status
Ɛnyɛ afeha a edi kan no mu Kristofo nhomasua titiriw na na wɔde nim wɔn
Many were unlettered and ordinary not having been trained in the rabbinical schools
Na wɔn mu pii nsuaa nhoma na na wɔyɛ mpapahwekwa ’ a wɔntetee wɔn wɔ rabifo sukuu ahorow mu
But this does not mean that they were uneducated
Nanso eyi nkyerɛ sɛ wɔansua nhoma
On the contrary these men and women were equipped to defend their faith an ability that gave evidence of solidly based learning
Acts
Nea ɛne eyi bɔ abira no na wɔasiesie mmarima ne mmea yi ma wɔbɔ wɔn gyidi ho ban tumi a edii adanse sɛ wɔanya adesua a ɛwɔ nhyɛase a ɛyɛ den
Asomafo no Nnwuma
All Christians therefore are keenly interested in education
Enti Kristofo nyinaa ani gye nhomasua ho yiye
At the same time they endeavor to make sure of the more important things keeping education and any other endeavor in its proper place
Philippians
Bere koro no ara no wɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛsɔ nneɛma a eye koraa no ahwɛ ’ na wɔma nhomasua ne ade foforo biara tra n’afa a ɛfata

Footnotes 	 Ase hɔ nsɛm 
It is noteworthy that highly educated apostle Paul chose to support himself in the ministry by means of tentmaking a trade that he likely learned from his father
Ɛfata sɛ yɛhyɛ no nsow sɛ ɔsomafo Paulo a na ɔyɛ nhomanimfo kɛse no paw sɛ ɔbɛpam ntamadan de ahwɛ ne ho wɔ ɔsom adwuma no mu adwuma a ebetumi aba sɛ osua fii ne papa hɔ
Tentmaking was not easy work

The goat hair cloth used called cilicium tended to be stiff and rough making it difficult to cut and sew
Acts Philippians

The expression quickly built refers to a highly organized method of construction developed by Jehovah s Witnesses
Asɛm wosisi no ahoɔhare so kyerɛ nhyehyɛe pa kɛse bi a Yehowa Adansefo ayɛ a wɔde sisi adan
The volunteers who work on these projects are not paid they give freely of their time and resources

A Well Earned Recommendation	Onyaa Nkamfo Kɛse a Ɛfata
The year before his graduation from high school Matthew thought seriously about how he could support himself while pursuing a career as a full time minister of Jehovah s Witnesses
Bere a aka afe ma Matthew awie ntoaso sukuu no osusuw sɛnea obetumi ahwɛ ne ho bere a ɔyɛ adwuma sɛ Yehowa Adansefo bere nyinaa somfo no ho anibere so
After prayerfully considering the matter Matthew and his parents felt that further education would be an asset to reaching his goal
Bere a Matthew ne n’awofo de mpaebɔ susuw asɛm no ho wiei no wɔtee nka sɛ ne nhomasua a ɔbɛtoa so no bɛboa ma wadu ne botae no ho
Thus he applied for a scholarship
Enti obisaa nhomasua mu mmoa
Matthew s school counselor added a letter of recommendation stating 	Matthew sukuu ho fotufo de nkamfo krataa kaa ho sɛ 
 During the past two and a half years it has been my pleasure to be Matt s counselor and friend
Ɛyɛ me anigye sɛ mayɛ Matt fotufo ne adamfo wɔ mfe abien a atwam no mu
Matt is a well grounded individual
Matt yɛ obi a ɔwɔ nhyɛase pa
He is deep in faith and strong in conviction which permeates his relationships and actions
Ɔwɔ gyidi ne ahotoso a emu yɛ den a ɛda adi wɔ ɔne afoforo ntam abusuabɔ ne nneyɛe mu
Over the years Matthew has been training for the ministry
Mfe dodow bi ni no Matthew resua ɔsom adwuma no
A minister of his faith does not receive any monetary compensation
Wɔmma n’asɔre no mu somfo sika fam akatua biara
It is truly a labor of love
Ɛyɛ adwuma a wofi ɔdɔ mu yɛ ankasa
A selfless young man Matt is thoughtful and considerate
Aberante yamyefo Matthew dwen afoforo ho
This scholarship can provide a means of support for this man of faith to continue his training and volunteer work
Nhomasua mu mmoa yi a aberante a ɔpɛ Nyankopɔn som yi rebisa no bɛma watumi ahwɛ ne ho na watoa ne ntetee ne adwuma a watu ne ho ama reyɛ no so
Speaking of volunteer work and community service Matt has conducted countless hours of door to door preaching on weekends and after school and during summers
Wɔ adwuma a wotu ho ma ne ɔman adwuma yɛ fam no Matt de nnɔnhwerew pii ayɛ afie afie asɛnka adwuma dapɛn awiei ne bere a wapɔn sukuu ne ahohuru bere mu
He works within the community and with a broad cross section of people
Ɔne nnipa ahorow pii yɛ adwuma wɔ kurow no mu
Matt has demonstrated his leadership abilities and skills in conducting Bible studies with both the young and the old alike
Matt ada tumi a otumi di nneɛma anim ne n’ahokokwaw adi denam Bible adesua a ɔne mmofra ne mpanyin nyinaa yɛ no so
He is able to inspire people and help them reach their true potential
Otumi kanyan nnipa na ɔboa wɔn ma wodu nea wobetumi ayɛ ho ankasa
Within the classroom teachers have commented that he is always a positive influence
Akyerɛkyerɛfo aka sɛ onya afoforo so nkɛntɛnso pa bere nyinaa wɔ sukuu mu
He leads class discussions and is a powerful debater
Odi nneɛma a sukuufo susuw ho anim na onim sɛnea woyi nsɛm ano yiye
Matt is one of the finest young men that I have had the pleasure to counsel

He is well liked and respected by his peers and teachers

If you like many mothers have decided to breast feed your baby you have chosen to make use of a provision lovingly made by the Creator of humankind
Te sɛ ɛnanom pii no sɛ woasi gyinae sɛ wobɛma wo ba nufu a ɛnde woapaw sɛ wode nsiesie bi a adesamma Bɔfo no fi ɔdɔ mu de ama bedi dwuma
The milk your own body produces will meet the exact nutritional needs of your baby promoting healthy growth and development
Nufusu a wo nipadua ankasa yɛ no bɛma wo ba no anya aduannuru a ohia no pɛpɛɛpɛ na aboa ma wanyin yiye
It will also help protect your baby against common diseases
Ɛbɛbɔ wo ba no ho ban afi nyarewa a ɛtaa yɛ nkokoaa ho nso
With good reason WHO World Health Organization states Breast milk is the best food a child will ever have
Ntease pa na WHO Wiase Nyinaa Akwahosan Ahyehyɛde de ka sɛ Nufusu ne aduan a eye sen biara a akokoaa betumi anya
All substitutes including cow s milk milk powder solutions and cereal gruels are inferior
Nea wɔde si ananmu biara a nantwi nufusu nufusu siam a wɔahono ne nnuan te sɛ aburow siam a wɔka nto no
Breast feeding brings benefits to you too
Nufuma ma wunya mfaso nso
There are no bottles to wash or sterilize and no trips to the kitchen in the middle of the night to prepare a meal for your baby
Ntoa biara nni hɔ a wobɛhohoro mu anaa wobɛnoa mu na saa ara na wonsɔre ɔdasu mu nkɔ gyaade nkɔyɛ aduan mma wo ba
Breast feeding will also benefit you physically since it will help you lose the weight you gained during pregnancy and will help your uterus return to its normal size
Nufuma so bɛba wo mfaso honam fam nso efisɛ ɛbɛboa wo ma kɛse a woyɛe bere a woyem no so atew na ɛbɛboa ma w’awotwaa adwom ayɛ sɛnea na ɛte
And studies suggest that women who breast feed their children are less likely to develop breast cancer
Na nhwehwɛmu ahorow kyerɛ sɛ mmea a wɔma wɔn mma nufu ntaa nnya nufu mu kokoram
Virtually every mother can breast feed her baby assures the United Nations Children s Fund
Amanaman Nkabom Mmofra Foto no ma awerɛhyem sɛ Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔbaatan biara betumi ama ne ba nufu
So likely you can too
Enti ɛda adi sɛ wo nso wubetumi ayɛ saa
You may discover however that breast feeding is not as easy as you expected especially if you are trying to do it for the first time
Nanso ebia wubehu sɛ nufuma nyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea na wohwɛ kwan no titiriw sɛ ɛne bere a edi kan a worebɔ mmɔden ayɛ saa a
This is because breast feeding while natural is not instinctive it is a skill that you must learn
Eyi te saa efisɛ ɛmfa ho sɛ nufuma yɛ ɔbrasu mu ade no ɛnyɛ nea wɔde wo ɛyɛ adeyɛ a ɛsɛ sɛ wusua
You may find that it takes you and your baby several days or even a few weeks to establish a comfortable and enjoyable routine

If you have not successfully breast fed a child before talk to mothers who have
Sɛ wuntumi mmaa akokoaa nufu pɛn a wo ne ɛnanom bi a wɔayɛ saa pɛn no nkasa
They can help you avoid or overcome problems
Wobetumi aboa wo ma woakwati anaa woadi ɔhaw ahorow so
They can also help build your confidence in your ability to breast feed your baby effectively
Wobetumi aboa wo nso ma woanya ahotoso wɔ sɛnea wubetumi ama wo ba nufu yiye mu
During pregnancy and afterward it is important that you get enough rest
Ɛho hia sɛ wunya ahomegye a ɛfata bere a woyem ne bere a woawo no
In addition make sure you eat sufficient food
Nea ɛka ho no ɛsɛ sɛ wohwɛ didi sɛnea ɛsɛ
Breastfeeding a WHO publication states Poor nutrition before or during pregnancy can be the cause of poor growth of the baby in the uterus
WHO nsɛmma nhoma Breastfeeding ka sɛ Didi a wonnidi yiye ansa na wɔanyinsɛn anaa bere a wɔyem no betumi ayɛ ade a ɛmma abofra ntumi nnyin yiye wɔ awotwaa mu
It can also mean that the mother is unable to store enough fat to produce sufficient milk later
Ebetumi aba nso sɛ ɛna no ntumi nnya srade a ɛfata a ɛbɛma wanya nufusu a ɛdɔɔso akyiri yi
The mother therefore needs throughout the pregnancy and breastfeeding period to eat a balanced diet based on a variety of foods
Enti ehia sɛ ɛna no di nnuan ahorow a ɛfata bere a ɔyem ne bere a ɔma nufu no nyinaa
Care of the breasts is also important
Nufu a wɔbɛhwɛ no yiye no nso ho hia
During the final months of pregnancy rinse your breasts when bathing but do not apply soap
Wɔ nyinsɛn no asram a etwa to mu no sɛ woreguare a hohoro wo nufu ho nanso mfa samena nka
Glands in the areola the dark area around the nipples secrete an antibacterial lubricant that keeps the nipples moist and guards against infection
Nea nufusu fi mu ba a ɛwɔ wo nufu ano hankare beae tuntum a atwa nufu ano ho ahyia no puw nsu bi a ɛko tia yare mmoawa na ɛkɔ so ma nufu no ano fɔw na ɛbɔ ho ban fi nyarewa ho
Soap can dry the nipples and remove or neutralize the lubricant
Samena betumi ama nufu no ano awo na apopa anaa adwudwo nsu a ɛfɔw nufu ano no
If your breasts become dry or itchy you may want to apply a soothing cream or lotion
Sɛ wo nufu ho wo anaa ɛkeka wo a wubetumi de nku anaa srade bi a ɛma ɛho dwo asra ho
But avoid getting it on the nipples or the areolae
Nanso kwati sɛ wode bɛsra nufu no ano anaa ne hankare no so
Doctors once recommended that mothers toughen their nipples during pregnancy by briskly rubbing them
Kan no na dɔktafo kamfo kyerɛ ɛnanom sɛ wɔmposa wɔn nufu ano ma ɛnyɛ den bere a wɔyem no
Although this was supposed to prevent nipple soreness during nursing studies show that such exercises do little good
Ɛwom sɛ na wosusuw sɛ eyi a wɔbɛyɛ no remma nufu no ano nyɛ kuru bere a wɔma nufu no de nanso nhwehwɛmu ada no adi sɛ adeyɛ a ɛte saa no mmoa ahe biara
Soreness usually results from incorrectly positioning the nursing baby at the breast
Nea ɛtaa ma kuru ba ne akokoaa no a wɔmfa no nto nufu no ano yiye
Breast size and shape are not factors in successful nursing but a baby cannot latch on to an inverted or flat nipple
Ɛnyɛ sɛnea nufu kɛse te na ɛma wotumi ma nufu yiye nanso akokoaa ntumi ntwe nufu a ano no aka akɔhyem anaa ayɛ tratra
You can test yourself by gently squeezing just behind each nipple with your thumb and forefinger to make sure the nipples extend outward
Wubetumi ahwɛ sɛnea wo de te de wo nsa kokurobeti ne akyerɛkyerɛkwan no amiamia nufu no biara ano ahwɛ ahu sɛ ano no apuepue
If they do not talk with your doctor

He may recommend a breast shell a simple device worn during pregnancy or between feedings
Ebia ɔbɛma woahyɛ nufu abon ade bi a n’afa horow nnɔɔso a wɔde hyɛ nufu ho bere a wɔyem anaa bere a abofra anum awie no
Shells often improve the shape of flat or inverted nipples
Abon yi taa boa nufu a ano ayɛ tratra anaa akɔhyem no yiye
The Early Days	Awo Akyi Pɛɛ
It is good for you to begin to breast feed your baby within an hour after giving birth
Eye sɛ wubefi ase ama wo ba nufu wɔ awo akyi dɔnhwerew no mu
Some might think that immediately after all the work of giving birth both mother and baby would be too tired to greet each other
Ebia ebinom besusuw sɛ awoko no akyi pɛɛ de na ɛna ne akokoaa no nyinaa abrɛ dodo sɛ wobenya nkitahodi bi
But mother usually brightens for the occasion and baby after taking a few minutes to adjust to life outside the womb eagerly seeks the comfort of the breast
Nanso ɛna no taa nya ahoɔden foforo ma adeyɛ no na bere a akokoaa no de simma kakraa ama awo akyi asetra akokwaw no no ɔde ahopere hwehwɛ nufu no de kyekye ne werɛ
New mothers can provide their newborn with a yellowish or clear substance called colostrum
Ɛnanom a wɔawo foforo betumi ama wɔn nkokoaa no nufusu a ani te sɛ akokɔsrade anaa nea ani tew a wɔfrɛ no colostrum no
This liquid gold is extremely beneficial for the baby
Saa sika nsunsu yi ye ma akokoaa no yiye
It contains components that fight harmful bacteria
Ekura nneɛma bi a ɛko tia ɔyare mmoawa
It is also rich in protein and low in sugar and fat making it the ideal food during the first few days of life
Aduannuru bi a wɔfrɛ no protein nso wom kɛse na asikre ne srade nnim pii na ɛma ɛyɛ aduan a ɛfata wɔ nna kakra a edi kan wɔ asetra mu no mu
Unless there is some medical problem the baby will require no other food or drink
Sɛ ɔyare ho asɛm biara nnim a akokoaa no renhia aduan anaa anonne foforo biara
Supplementary bottle feeding can discourage a baby from feeding at the breast since less effort is required to suck from a bottle
Toa mu aduan a wɔde bɛma akokoaa no betumi ama wagyae nufu num efisɛ ne twe nyɛ den
Mothers generally begin to produce milk without colostrum from two to five days after giving birth
Ɛnanom taa nya nufusu a colostrum nnim wɔ awo akyi nnanu kosi nnanum
The increased flow of blood to the breasts at this time may enlarge your breasts and make them tender
Ebia mogya pii a ɛba wo nufu mu saa bere yi no bɛma wo nufu ayeyɛ akɛse na ama ayɛ wo yaw
This is normal
Asɛm biara nni eyi ho
Nursing will usually alleviate the discomfort
Num a akokoaa no benum no bɛma ɛyaw no so atew
Sometimes though swollen breasts will cause the nipples to flatten
Nanso ɛtɔ da bi a nufu a ahonhon no ma nufu no ano yɛ tratra
Since this makes it difficult for the baby to suck you may have to release some milk manually
Esiane sɛ eyi ma ɛyɛ den ma akokoaa no sɛ obenum nti ebia ɛho behia sɛ w’ankasa wotwe nufusu no bi
You can do this by using both hands to massage each breast starting from its base and working toward the nipple
Wubetumi ayɛ eyi denam wo nsa abien a wode bemiamia wo nufu no biara fi soro ba ano no so
You cannot measure how much milk your baby takes from the breast but do not worry your body is equipped to supply all that baby requires even if baby is twins !	Wuntumi nsusuw nufusu dodow a wo ba no num nanso mma ɛnnhaw wo wo nipadua no wɔ ahoɔden a ebetumi ama wo ba no anya nufusu biara a ohia sɛ wɔyɛ ntafo mpo a !
The more you nurse the more milk you will produce
Dodow a woma nufu no dodow no ara na wunya nufusu pii
This is one reason why you should not supplement breast milk with other bottle fed drinks such as milk powder solutions or cow s milk
Eyi ne ade biako nti a ɛnsɛ sɛ wode ntoa mu nnuan te sɛ nufusu siam a wɔahono ne nantwi nufusu ka nufusu a onum no ho no
If you do your baby will take less from you

This in turn means you will produce less milk
Eyi nso kyerɛ sɛ wunnya nufusu pii
Full term normal babies are not nearly as helpless at birth as has been thought and they can organise their own meals to suit themselves and their mother s bodies if only other people will let them do it writes Gabrielle Palmer in The Politics of Breastfeeding
Gabrielle Palmer kyerɛw wɔ The Politics of Breastfeeding mu sɛ Nkokoaa a wɔwo wɔn asram akron a wɔnyare nyɛ nea wontumi nyɛ hwee bere a wɔawo wɔn foforo sɛnea wɔasusuw no na wɔn ankasa tumi yɛ wɔn adidi ho nhyehyɛe sɛnea ɛfata wɔn ankasa ne wɔn nanom nipadua sɛ afoforo bɛma wɔn kwan nkutoo a
The guiding principle is that of supply and demand when your baby demands food usually by crying you supply
Nnyinasosɛm a ɛwom ne ma a wɔde biribi ma ne gye a wogye bere a wo ba bisa aduan no mpɛn pii no ɔde su na ɛyɛ saa wode ma no
Initially demands will come every two or three hours
Mfiase no ɔbɛhwehwɛ no nnɔnhwerew abien anaa abiɛsa biara ntam
You should allow your baby to nurse at both breasts each time he nurses
Ɛsɛ sɛ woma wo ba no num nufu abien no nyinaa ano bere biara a obenum no
Most babies take from to minutes to complete a feeding though some babies like to dine at their leisure with pauses
Nkokoaa dodow no ara de efi simma kosi na ewie num ɛwom sɛ nkokoaa binom pɛ sɛ wɔto wɔn bo ase num ma enti wogyinagyina bere a wonum no
Such slowpokes may take up to minutes to finish their meal
Nkokoaa a wonum nyaa saa no de simma bɛyɛ na ebenum awie
Generally your baby is getting enough to eat if he nurses at least eight times in hours if you can hear him swallowing and if he has eight or more wet diapers a day after the fifth day
Sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no wo ba num mpɛn awotwe wɔ nnɔnhwerew mu na sɛ wutumi te sɛ ɔretwe na ogu nsu gya n’anan mpɛn awotwe anaa nea ɛsen saa da koro wɔ n’awo akyi nnanum a ɛnde na wo ba no nya aduan a ɛsɛ di
A most important skill you need to master in breast feeding is how to hold your baby correctly at the breast
Ahokokwaw a ɛho hia sen biara a ɛsɛ sɛ wunya wɔ nufuma mu ne sɛnea wode wo ba no bɛto yiye bere a otua nufu ano no
Bad positioning can result in your baby s not getting enough milk
Sɛ woamfa wo ba no anto yiye a ontumi nnum kɛse
Some babies even refuse to feed
Nkokoaa binom mpo gyae num
Bad positioning can result in another common problem cracked or sore nipples
Akokoaa a wɔmfa no nto yiye betumi de ɔhaw foforo aba nufu ano a ɛyɛ kuru
Breastfeeding Source Book states Sore nipples are caused by a number of factors but an important one is how well the baby latches on and that in turn depends to a considerable extent on what position his head is in in relationship to the breast
Breastfeeding Source Book ka sɛ Nneɛma ahorow bi na ɛde nufu ano kuru ba nanso biako titiriw ne sɛnea akokoaa no so nufu no mu ’ na nea ɛno nso gyina so kɛse ne beae a akokoaa no ti da bere a otua nufu no ano no
For correct positioning your baby should be in close with his head neutral not looking up down or to the side and coming straight at the nipple so he doesn t pull it to one side

Ideally the infant s lips should form a seal on the breast at least an inch cm behind the nipple
Ne yiye mu no ɛsɛ sɛ akokoaa no anofafa no kata nufu no ano denneennen anyɛ yiye koraa no ɛkata ano kosi akyi sɛntimita
You will know that the position is correct if your baby s whole body is turned toward you if he takes long sucks if he is relaxed and happy and if you do not feel nipple pain

When to Wean	Bere a Ɛsɛ sɛ Wotwa Nufu
After the first few weeks both you and your baby will have come to know each other and will probably have established a comfortable and enjoyable routine
Ebedi adapɛn kakra no na wo ne wo ba no ahu mo ho na ebia moanya nufuma no ho nhyehyɛe a ahotɔ wom na ɛyɛ anigye
For the next four to six months your baby will need no food or drink other than breast milk
Wo ba no renhia aduan anaa anonne foforo bi nka nufusu no ho wɔ asram anan kosi asia a edi hɔ no mu
After that time you should gradually introduce other foods such as mashed vegetables cereals or fruits
Efi saa bere no rekɔ no ɛsɛ sɛ woma no nnuan foforo te sɛ nnuadewa awi anaa nnuaba a wɔayam nkakrankakra
However until your baby is nine or ten months old his main nourishment will still come from your milk so it is good always to nurse your baby before giving solid foods
Nanso enkosi sɛ wo ba no bedi asram akron anaa du no wo nufusu no na ɛbɛda so ara ayɛ aduan titiriw a odi enti eye sɛ bere nyinaa wobɛma wo ba no nufu ansa na woama no nnuan a ɛyɛ den
How long should you continue breast feeding ?	Bere tenten bɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ wokɔ so ma no nufu ?

Many mothers continue nursing well into the second year keeping an eye on their children and not the calendar
Ɛnanom binom kɔ so ma nufu ara kodu afe a ɛto so abien no mu a wɔma wɔn adwene ku wɔn mma no ho sen sɛ wobedwen mfe a wadi ho
The book Mothering Your Nursing Toddler states It is not difficult to see the need our children have for continued nursing their joy in nursing and their distress when it is denied

Evidence of a Loving Creator	Edi Ɔbɔadeɛ a Ɔwɔ Dɔ bi ho Adanse
As you breast feed your baby perhaps late at night when the rest of the family is sleeping give thought to the Creator of this arrangement
Bere a woma wo ba nufu ebia ɔdasum bere a abusua no mufo a aka adeda no dwen Ɔbɔadeɛ a ɔyɛɛ saa nhyehyɛe yi no ho
Even if you do not understand the complex physical processes that make it possible the wonder of breast feeding will help you see the wisdom and love of our Creator

Think about it there is no better food for babies than mother s milk
Susuw ho aduan foforo biara nni hɔ a eye ma nkokoaa sen ɛna nufusu
It totally meets a baby s requirements for food and drink during the early months of life
Edi akokoaa aduan ne anonne mu ahiade ahorow ho dwuma kosi ase wɔ ne nkwa nna mu asram a edi kan no mu
At the same time it is a wonder drug that protects against disease
Bere koro no ara no ɛyɛ aduru a ɛyɛ nnam a ɛko tia nyarewa
It is safe hygienic requires no preparation and costs nothing
Asiane nnim ɛho tew enhia sɛ wɔyɛ na wɔmmɔ ho ka biara
It is universally available and its production increases as the infant grows bigger
Wotumi nya bi wɔ baabiara na ɛkɔ so dɔɔso bere a akokoaa no nyin no
And think about the fact that breast feeding is a pleasurable experience for both mother and child
Na susuw nokwasɛm a ɛyɛ sɛ nufuma yɛ adeyɛ a ɛyɛ anigye ma ɛna ne abofra nyinaa no ho
The giving of food the oral and skin to skin contact and the physical warmth of breast feeding all help promote a strong bond of love and intimacy between mother and child

The Trumpet From Battlefield to Concert Hall	Torobɛnto Afi Akono Aba Agodidan Mu
IN THE time of King Abijah the warriors of Judah were caught in an ambush
ƆHENE Abia bere so no atɛwfo bi tow hyɛɛ Yuda akofofo so mpofirim
Surrounded by enemy soldiers they were outnumbered to
Atamfo asraafo twaa wɔn ho hyiae na na wɔn mu biara ko tia nnipa
Escape seemed impossible
Na ɛte sɛ nea wonnya wɔn ho ntetew
Suddenly the sound of trumpets pierced the air !	Prɛko pɛ na wɔtee ntorobɛnto nnyigyei wɔ wim !
As the adrenaline surged through their veins the men of Judah shouted a resounding war cry and rushed into battle
Bere a ɛkaa Yuda mmarima no ma wɔn ani beree no wɔtoo ɔsa dwom denneennen na wɔde ɔko no hyehyɛɛ so ntɛm
Despite the odds against them the Judeans defeated the enemy
Chronicles
Ɛmfa ho sɛ na atamfo no dɔɔso sen Yudafo no wodii wɔn so nkonim
Beresosɛm
How stirring it must have been to hear those trumpets !	Hwɛ sɛnea ebia ntorobɛnto nnyigyei a wɔtee no kanyan wɔn !
It undoubtedly reminded the Judeans of Jehovah s promise In case you should enter into war in your land against the oppressor who is harassing you you must also sound a war call on the trumpets and you will certainly be remembered before Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies
Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛkaee Yudafo no Yehowa bɔhyɛ yi Na sɛ morekɔ ɔsa mo asase so ne ahohiafo a wohiahia mo ho akɔko a ɛnde momfa ntorobɛnto nhyɛn osebɔ na wɔnkae mo Yehowa mo Nyankopɔn anim na wonnye mo nkwa mo atamfo no nsam
The sounding of the trumpets demonstrated Judah s trust in Jehovah and that trust was rewarded
Ntorobɛnto a wɔhyɛnee no daa Yehowa mu ahotoso a na Yudafo no wɔ adi na wonyaa saa ahotoso no so akatua
The history of the trumpet goes back much further than this Biblical incident
Torobɛnto ho abakɔsɛm fii ase bere tenten ansa na saa Bible asɛm yi resi
The metal trumpet can be traced back to Egypt about years before Christ
Dade torobɛnto nyaa ne mfiase wɔ Misraim bɛyɛ mfe ansa na Kristo reba
These ancient trumpets were quite different from the ones we know today

The Early Stages	Ne Mfiase
The English word trumpet is derived from an Old French word trompe that refers to an elephant s trunk
Engiresi asɛmfua a wɔkyerɛ ase torobɛnto no fi Tete Franse asɛmfua trompe a ɛkyerɛ ɔsono mfare mu
Evidently primitive trumpets looked like the proboscis of an elephant

Greek dramatist Aeschylus B

called the sound of the trumpet shattering

Its use was restricted to war signals funeral or festal occasions athletic contests and other public events
Nea na wɔde yɛ ara ne sɛ wɔde ma sɛnkyerɛnne wɔ akodi mu de yɛ ayi afahyɛ agumadi akansi ne guasodeyɛ afoforo
While the trumpets of Israel were used for military signals they also provided music in the temple
Bere a wɔde Israel ntorobɛnto maa sɛnkyerɛnne wɔ sraadi mu no wɔde bɔɔ nnwom nso wɔ asɔrefi hɔ
Skilled craftsmen were employed to manufacture high quality instruments out of silver
Wɔfaa adwumfo a wɔn ho akokwaw maa wɔde dwetɛ yɛɛ mmɛn a ɛyɛ papa paa
In the temple trumpeters played in such unison that they were described as one in causing one sound to be heard in perfect harmony Today s English Version
Chronicles

’ Beresosɛm
So Israel s trumpets were by no means crude either to the eyes or to the ears
Enti na Israel ntorobɛnto no nyɛ adwimpori anaasɛ nea ne nnyigyei nyɛ dɛ koraa
However like the trumpets of surrounding nations they could produce only a limited number of tones
Nanso te sɛ aman a na atwa wɔn ho ahyia ntorobɛnto no na enni nnyigyei a egu ahorow pii
Centuries would pass before the trumpet s capabilities were enhanced
Na mfehaha pii betwam ansa na sɛnea torobɛnto no gyigye anya nkɔanim
Development of the Modern Trumpet	Sɛnea Wobenyaa Nnɛyi Torobɛnto No
To increase the trumpet s tonal range its design had to be modified
Nea ɛbɛyɛ na torobɛnto atumi anya nnyigyei a egu ahorow pii no na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔsakra sɛnea ɛte no
First the length was extended
Nea edi kan no wɔyɛɛ no tenten
A longer instrument it was reasoned would have a larger repertoire of notes
Wosusuwii sɛ sɛ abɛn no ware a ebenya nnyigyei ahorow pii
A medieval trumpet called the buisine was actually six feet
m long !	Na mfinimfini bere no mu torobɛnto bi wɔfrɛ no buisine tenten yɛ anammɔn asia !
As can be imagined it was awkward to play
Sɛnea wobetumi asusuw ho no na ne bɔ yɛ den
Thus in the th century the trumpet was bent into an S shape for manageability
Enti wɔ afeha a ɛto so mu no wɔkonton torobɛnto no ma ɛbɛyɛɛ te sɛ nkyerɛwde S na ama ɛho dwumadi ayɛ mmerɛw
A century later it had acquired an oblong loop with three parallel branches
Afeha biako akyi no wɔyɛɛ no kurukuruwa a nnade abiɛsa beabea mu
The new trumpet could sound more tones but only in a higher register
Na torobɛnto foforo no tumi nya nnyigyei ahorow pii nanso na ɛyɛ nea ano yɛ den nkutoo
These notes were difficult to reach
Na nnyigyei ahorow yi bɔ yɛ den
Nonetheless some began to write music for clarino suitable for higher range parts
Nanso ebinom fii ase hyehyɛɛ nnwom a wɔbɔɔ no clarino a na etumi nya nnyigyei a ano yɛ den no so
One famous composer of that era was Johann Sebastian Bach
Saa bere no mu nnwom hyehyɛfo a na wagye din biako ne Johann Sebastian Bach
Eventually extra coils of tubing called crooks were added to the trumpet
Bere kɔɔ so no wɔyɛɛ adorobɛn afoforo a na wɔfrɛ no kuntun bobaree torobɛnto no ho
The idea was simple Additional tubing increased the length of the main column of air thereby producing a wider pitch range
Na adwene a ɛwɔ akyi no asete nyɛ den Adorobɛn a wɔde kaa ho no maa mframa a egyina mu no dɔɔso na ɛmaa nnyigyei a na wɔbɔ nya no yɛɛ pii
The crooks lowered the common key of the trumpet from F down to as low as B flat
Akuntun no brɛɛ torobɛnto no nnyigyei titiriw no ase fii nea wɔfrɛ no F no so baa fam beduu nea wɔfrɛ no B flat no so
Thus by the time of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart high pitched clarino playing had disappeared
Enti eduu Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart bere so no na wɔagyae clarino a ne nnyigyei ano yɛ den no bɔ
The clarinet came to handle the higher register with relative ease while the trumpet now occupied the middle range
Wobenyaa clarinet a sɛ wɔde toto ho a na ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wɔbɛbɔ anya nnyigyei a ano yɛ den no na afei de wɔbɔɔ torobɛnto nyaa nnyigyei a ɛyɛ hɔ ne hɔ
This new trumpet was versatile
Na torobɛnto foforo yi nnyigyei gu ahorow pii
But it was still awkward to play for adjusting the crooks demanded the use of both hands
Nanso na ne bɔ da so ara yɛ den efisɛ na ehia sɛ wɔde nsa abien no nyinaa kyinkyim akuntun no
Hence further changes were in order
Enti na ɛfata sɛ wɔyɛ nsakrae afoforo
A Trumpet With Keys	Torobɛnto a Ɛwɔ Nkyerɛwa
About a Russian musician named Kolbel made a breakthrough discovery
Bɛyɛ afe no Russiani dwontofo bi a wɔfrɛ no Kolbel de nkɔanim kɛse bi bae
He placed a hole near the bell of the trumpet and covered it with a padded key that served as a stopper
Otuu tokuru bi a ɛbɛn torobɛnto no ano na ɔde kyerɛwa bi a ntama kyekyere ho siw ano sɛ ntuaano
Opening this key raised the tone of the trumpet one half step at any note
Sɛ wobue kyerɛwa yi a na ɛma torobɛnto no nnyigyei biara a wɔbɔ no kɔ soro kakra
In a trumpeter from Vienna named Anton Weidinger improved Kolbel s design by producing a trumpet with five keys
Wɔ afe mu no torobɛntohyɛnfo bi a ofi Vienna a wɔfrɛ no Anton Weidinger maa nea Kolbel yɛe no nyaa nkɔanim denam torobɛnto a ɛwɔ nkyerɛwa anum a ɔyɛe so
Finally there existed a trumpet that could produce all the notes of the scale without being cumbersome to play
Awiei koraa no wobenyaa torobɛnto a etumi ma nnyigyei ahorow no nyinaa a ne bɔ nyɛ den
Even Weidinger s trumpet however had a grave limitation
Nanso na Weidinger torobɛnto no mpo tɔ kyima kɛse
The opening of the keys interfered with the instrument s resonance compromising the trumpet s distinguishable sound
Na nkyerɛwa no bue ka sɛnea abɛn no mu mframa di dwuma no na amma torobɛnto no annyigye yiye
The keyed trumpet therefore did not last
Enti torobɛnto a ɛwɔ nkyerɛwa no ankyɛ
It was soon abandoned in favor of a totally new approach to trumpet design
Wɔde ɔkwan foforo koraa a wɔfa so yɛ torobɛnto besii ɛno ananmu
The First Valve Trumpet	Torobɛnto a Edi Kan a Ɛwɔ Mmuaso
In Heinrich Stolzel of Silesia bought the patent for an invention that applied pistons or valves to the trumpet
Wɔ afe mu no Heinrich Stolzel a ofi Silesia gyee tumi krataa de yɛɛ torobɛnto bi a ɛwɔ ntuaano anaa mmuaso
By means of their strategically placed holes each valve would divert the column of air from the main tube to an attached crook
Ɛdenam mmuaso no ntokuru a wɔayeyɛ wɔ mmeae a ɛfata so no na emu biara bɛdan dorobɛn kɛse no mu mframa ani akɔ kuntun bi a ɛbɔ ho mu
Thus several crooks of differing lengths could be employed simultaneously in any combination
Enti na wotumi de akuntun pii a ɛsono ebiara tenten di dwuma wɔ bere koro mu
Furthermore because the valves were spring loaded instant reaction was possible
Bio nso esiane sɛ na spring hyɛ mmuaso no mu nti na wobetumi amia so agyae mu prɛko pɛ
At first this trumpet had problems with accurate intonation
Mfiase no na torobɛnto yi ntumi nnyigye sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no
As the years passed however these imperfections were corrected and the valve trumpet has persisted to this day
Nanso mfe bi twaam no wosiesiee eyinom na torobɛnto a ɛwɔ mmuaso no atra hɔ abesi nnɛ
Renowned for Versatility	Agye Din sɛ Ɛwɔ Nnyigyei Ahorow Pii
The trumpet has a place in virtually all types of music
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔde torobɛnto bɔ dwom biara
It blends well with voice and with other instruments
Sɛ wɔde ka ɛnne ne mmɛn afoforo ho a ɛne no kɔ yiye
Its heroic martial tone makes it effective for fanfares and marches
Ne nnyigyei a ɛso na ɛte sɛ ɔsa mu de no ma ɛfata ma guasodeyɛ ne aperententu ahorow
At the same time it has a brilliant vibrant resonance that is well suited for concerti operas and modern jazz
Bere koro no ara ɛwɔ nnyigyei a ɛyɛ dɛ na ɛkanyan nkate a ɛfata yiye ma nnwonto ɔyɛkyerɛ ahorow a wɔbɔ nnwom ka ho ne nnɛyi sankudwom
Moreover because of its rich lyrical qualities the trumpet admirably lends itself to ballads and is often featured in solo pieces

During that time radiation treatments were started

Bere a na yɛresiesie yɛn ho akɔ asɔre wɔ fefɛw bere a edi hɔ no Easter Kwasida no esiane me mogya a na ɛso atew nti me hwene fii ase pɔnee
My parents tried everything but the blood kept coming
M’awofo bɔɔ mmɔden biara nanso mogya no kɔɔ so bae
Doctors stopped the bleeding by packing my nose with gauze but then the blood started coming through my mouth
Dɔktafo no de asaawa hyehyɛɛ me hwenem de siw mogya no ano nanso afei mogya no fii ase faa m’anom
I became very weak from loss of blood and was admitted to the hospital
Mogya a mehweree no maa meyɛɛ mmerɛw kɛse na wogyee me too ayaresabea
To keep from infecting me those visiting me had to wear gloves a face mask and a gown over their clothing
Nea ɛbɛyɛ na wɔamfa yare bi ansan me no na wɔn a wɔbɛsra me no hyehyɛ ahyɛnsa nkataanim ne atade tenten gu wɔn ntade so
In a week my blood count had risen enough for me to be released from the hospital
Edii dapɛn biako no na me mogya kɔ soro ma woyii me fii ayaresabea
Chemotherapy was immediately resumed
Wɔsan fii ase maa me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa ntɛm ara
I couldn t attend school and I really missed it
Mantumi ankɔ sukuu na m’ani gyinae ankasa
I missed my friends and playing outside with them
M’ani gyinaa me nnamfo ne agoru a na me ne wɔn di wɔ abɔnten no
I received home tutoring since my doctors felt that I shouldn t attend school while on chemotherapy or too soon after it was discontinued
Esiane sɛ me dɔktafo no tee nka sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ sukuu bere a wɔrema me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no anaa ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi nti wɔkyerɛɛ me ade wɔ fie
That summer I wanted to visit my grandparents in Georgia as I usually did but I was not permitted to go
Saa ahohuru bere no mepɛe sɛ mekɔsra me nananom wɔ Georgia sɛnea na metaa yɛ no nanso wɔamma mankɔ
However the hospital arranged for cancer patients to go to an amusement park in New Jersey
Nanso ayaresabea no yɛɛ nhyehyɛe maa ayarefo a wɔyare kokoram kɔsraa anigyebea bi a ɛwɔ New Jersey
Although I was exhausted afterward I had enjoyed myself
Ɛwom sɛ ɛno akyi no mebrɛe de nanso m’ani gyei
I finished chemotherapy late in but continued to receive home tutoring altogether for more than three years
Miwiee nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no a na wɔde ma me no wɔ awiei de nanso wɔkɔɔ so kyerɛɛ me ade wɔ fie sɛ wɔka ne nyinaa bom a na ɛboro mfe abiɛsa
When I returned to school in January it wasn t easy to adjust after being taught at home for so long
Bere a mesan kɔɔ sukuu wɔ January no na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw mma me sɛ mɛyɛ nsakrae esiane sɛ na wɔakyerɛ me ade wɔ fie bere tenten nti
Sometimes I would get lost trying to find my class
Ɛtɔ da bi a na meyera bere a merehwehwɛ me mfɛfo sukuufo no
Yet I really liked school
Nanso na mepɛ sukuu ankasa
I especially liked music typing and gym class
Na mepɛ nnwonto tapbɔ ne apɔwmu teɛteɛ ho adesua titiriw
Some of the kids were friendly but others would make fun of me
Na mmofra no bi pɛ nnipa nanso na afoforo di me ho fɛw
A Setback	Akwanside Bi
 Are you pregnant ? kids began asking me
Mmofra fii ase bisaa me sɛ Woyem anaa ? 
This was because my stomach was swollen
Esiane sɛ na me yafunu ahon nti na wɔyɛɛ saa
The doctor told me not to worry and that the reason was that my liver was growing back
Dɔkta no ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ memmma ɛnnhaw me na ɛyɛ me mmerɛbo a ɛresan anyin no ntia
When I received a checkup in March however the doctor put me in the hospital
Nanso bere a wɔsan hwehwɛɛ me mu wɔ March mu no dɔkta no gyee me too ayaresabea hɔ
I started to cry I had been able to attend school for only two and a half months
Mifii ase sui na matumi akɔ sukuu asram abien ne fa pɛ
A biopsy was performed in which tissue was taken from a tumor in my liver
Wɔyɛɛ me oprehyɛn yii biribi fii ade a na ahon me mmerɛbo mu no mu
When waking up after the procedure the first person I saw was Mommy
Bere a wowiei a m’ani so retetew me no onipa a midii kan huu no ne Maame
She was crying
Na ɔresu
She told me that I had cancer again and that the tumor was too big to take out and that I would have to have chemotherapy to shrink it
Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ manya kokoram bio na ade a ahon me no so dodo sɛ wobeyi ma enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔma me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa ma ɛdwom
I was still only
Na madi mfe pɛ
The chemotherapy was administered in the hospital which meant I went in for two or three days at a time every few weeks
Wɔmaa me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no wɔ ayaresabea hɔ a na ɛkyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ mikodi hɔ nnanu anaa nnansa wɔ adapɛn kakraa biara akyi
As usual I suffered from nausea and vomiting
Sɛnea ɛte daa no me bo fonoo me na mefee
Food tasted bland and I lost all my hair
Na aduan nyɛ me dɛ na me ti nhwi nyinaa tutui
Chemotherapy treatments continued throughout
Wɔkɔɔ so maa me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa wɔ nyinaa
In the meantime in April I started home schooling again
Mifii ofie adesua ase bio wɔ April mu
Early in when I was admitted to the hospital for surgery I was so weak that the nurses had to help me on and off the scale
Bere a wogyee me too ayaresabea hɔ na wɔayɛ me oprehyɛn wɔ mfiase no na mayɛ mmerɛw araa ma na ɛsɛ sɛ ayarehwɛfo no boa me ansa na matumi agyina nsenia so anaa masi afi so
The chemotherapy had shrunk the tumor so surgeons were able to remove it along with another part of my liver
Nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no a wɔde maa me no maa ade a ahon me no dwomee enti dɔktafo no tumi yii ɛno ne me mmerɛbo fa foforo
Again I was in the hospital for about two months
Mesan dii bɛyɛ asram abien wɔ ayaresabea hɔ
Toward the middle of I resumed chemotherapy which continued until early
Ɛde rekɔ mfinimfini no wofii ase maa me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no araa na ɛkɔɔ so de kosii mfiase
During this time I was sad because I couldn t go to school
Saa bere yi esiane sɛ na mintumi nkɔ sukuu nti na me werɛ ahow
But then my hair grew back and I started to feel good again
Nanso me ti nhwi fuwee na me ho fii ase tɔɔ me bio
I was happy to be alive
M’ani gyei sɛ mete nkwa mu
Finally Back to School	Awiei Koraa no Mesan Kɔ Sukuu
My home tutor arranged for me to graduate from junior high school with the class that I was with briefly in
Tikyani a na ɔkyerɛ me ade wɔ fie no yɛɛ nhyehyɛe maa me ne me mfɛfo sukuufo a me ne wɔn bɔe bere tiaa bi wɔ no wiee mfiase sukuu
I was very excited about this it was nice to see my friends and to make new ones
M’ani gyee eyi ho kɛse na ɛyɛ anigye sɛ mehu me nnamfo na manya foforo
When graduation day came in June I took pictures of friends and teachers and my family took pictures of me to record this special event
Bere a ɛda a yɛde bewie sukuu no dui wɔ June mu no mitwitwaa me nnamfo ne atikyafo mfonini na m’abusua no twitwaa me mfonini de yɛɛ da titiriw yi ho nkae
That summer I went to visit my grandparents in Georgia and stayed most of the summer
Saa ahohuru bere no mekɔsraa me nananom wɔ Georgia na midii ahohuru bere no fa kɛse wɔ hɔ
When I returned in late August it was time to get ready for school
Mesan bae August awiei no na bere aso sɛ misiesie me ho kɔ sukuu
Yes I was finally going back to school
Yiw awiei koraa no na meresan akɔ sukuu
I was so excited !	M’ani gyei kɛse !
Curious About Religion	Mepɛe sɛ Mihu Nyamesom Mu
Dawn and Craig were different from other students and I was drawn to them
Na Dawn ne Craig yɛ soronko wɔ sukuufo a aka no ho na ɛmaa mebɛn wɔn
When I gave them Christmas presents though they said they didn t celebrate the holiday
Nanso bere a mekyɛɛ wɔn Buronya ade no wɔkae sɛ wonni dapɔnna no
Are you Jewish ? I asked
Mibisae sɛ Moyɛ Yudafo anaa ? 
Craig explained that they were Jehovah s Witnesses and that Christmas wasn t really Christian
Craig kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ wɔyɛ Yehowa Adansefo na Buronya nyɛ Kristofo afahyɛ ankasa
He gave me some Watchtower and Awake !	Ɔmaa me Ɔwɛn Aban ne Nyan !
magazines to read on the subject
nsɛmma nhoma ahorow a ɛfa asɛm no ho sɛ menkenkan
I became curious about their religion which seemed so different
Mepɛe sɛ mihu wɔn som a na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ soronko koraa no mu
When I went to church we would hear the same thing over and over again Believe in Jesus Christ get baptized and you will get to heaven
Sɛ mekɔ asɔre a asɛnkoro no ara na na yɛte no bere nyinaa Gye Yesu di bɔ asu na wobɛkɔ soro
’
But that seemed too easy
Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ mmerɛw dodo
I had come to believe that when things are too easy you are either a genius or something is wrong
Na mabegye adi sɛ sɛ nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw ma wo dodo a na woyɛ obi a w’adwene korɔn kɛse anaasɛ biribi atoto
I knew that I was not a genius so I concluded that something must be wrong with what the church was teaching
Na minim sɛ menyɛ obi a m’adwene korɔn kɛse nti mekae sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mfomso wɔ nea asɔre no kyerɛkyerɛ no mu
Eventually Craig began studying the Bible with me during our lunch breaks
Awiei koraa no Craig fii ase ne me suaa Bible no awiabere a na yekodidi no
One day he invited me to an assembly of Jehovah s Witnesses and I went
Ɔtoo nsa frɛɛ me da koro sɛ memmra Yehowa Adansefo nhyiam bi ase na mekɔe
I found Craig and sat with him and his family
Mihuu Craig na metraa ɔne n’abusua nkyɛn
I was impressed by what I saw people of different races worshiping together in unity and I was also impressed by what I heard
Nea mihui no maa me ho dwiriw me nnipa a wofi mmusua ahorow mu a wɔbom som wɔ biakoyɛ mu nea metee no nso yɛɛ me ahodwiriw
When Craig and I got new classes we could no longer study the Bible together because we didn t share the same lunch period
Bere a wɔansan amfa me ne Craig ankɔ sukuu dan biako mu no yɛantumi ammom ansua Bible no bio efisɛ na yɛmmom nkodidi wɔ bere koro mu
Craig s mother called my mother to see if she could study with me but Mommy said no
Craig maame behuu me maame sɛ ebia obetumi ne me asua ade a nanso Maame kae sɛ ɔmpene
Later she gave me permission to go to Christian meetings
Akyiri yi ɔmaa me kwan sɛ menkɔ Kristofo nhyiam horow
So I called a Kingdom Hall listed in the phone book and learned that the meeting began at a
m
on Sunday
Enti mehwɛɛ telefon nɔma nhoma mu frɛɛ Ahenni Asa bi sofo ne wɔn kasae na mihui sɛ na wofi nhyiam no ase Kwasida anɔpa
The day before I walked about blocks to the Kingdom Hall to make sure I knew the way
Ade rebɛkye ma makɔ no menantew twaa afie bɛyɛ ho kɔɔ Ahenni Asa no so de hwɛ hui sɛ mehu kwan no
When I arrived the following morning a man asked me if I was visiting from another Kingdom Hall
Bere a miduu hɔ ɛda a edi hɔ anɔpa no ɔbarima bi bisaa me sɛ ebia mifi Ahenni Asa foforo so na merebɛsra wɔn anaa
I told him that this was my first visit but that I had studied for a short time
Meka kyerɛɛ no sɛ ɛno ne da a edi kan a maba hɔ nanso mifii ase suaa ade nkyɛe
He kindly invited me to sit with him and his wife
Ofi ayamye mu too nsa frɛɛ me ma mekɔtraa ɔne ne yere nkyɛn
The meetings were so different from church
Na nhyiam horow no yɛ soronko koraa wɔ asɔre ho
I was amazed at how eager many were to comment during the question and answer session
Sɛnea na nnipa pii wɔ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔbɛma mmuae wɔ asemmisa ne mmuae afa ho no maa m’ani gyei
Even young children gave comments
Mmofra nkumaa mpo maa mmuae
I raised my hand and answered a question too
Me nso memaa me nsa so maa mmuae
From that time on I continued attending meetings and began progressing in an understanding of Bible truths
Efi saa bere no rekɔ no metoaa so kɔɔ nhyiam horow na mifii ase nyaa nkɔso wɔ Bible mu nokware ahorow ho ntease mu
Another Setback	Akwanside Foforo
In December during my final year in high school I went for a routine checkup
Wɔ December mu bere a na mewɔ afe a etwa to wɔ ntoaso sukuu mu no mekɔɔ ayaresabea sɛ wɔnyɛ me mu nhwehwɛmu sɛnea wɔyɛ daa no
What the doctor saw in my right lung made him suspicious so I was called back for further X rays
Ade bi a dɔkta no hui wɔ m’ahurututu a ɛwɔ me nifa so mu no maa n’adwenem yɛɛ no naa enti wɔsan frɛɛ me sɛ minkotwa foto bio
When I learned that these revealed that something was definitely wrong I started to cry
Bere a mihui sɛ ada adi sɛ biribi atoto ankasa no mifii ase sui
A biopsy was performed the doctor used a needle to take a piece of the tumor from my lung
Wɔyɛɛ me mu nhwehwɛmu dɔkta no de paane twee ade a na ahon m’ahurututu mu no kakra
The growth proved to be cancerous
Ɛdaa adi sɛ ade a na ahon me no yɛ kokoram
In fact there were three tumors including a large one near the arteries of my heart
Nokwarem no mmeae ahorow abiɛsa na na ahonhon a na kɛse biako a ɛbɛn me koma mu ntini ho no ka ho
After a discussion with the doctor we decided that I would take two experimental chemotherapy drugs to shrink the tumors before the operation
Bere a yɛne dɔkta no susuw ho akyi no yesii gyinae sɛ wɔbɛma me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no abien bi de ahwɛ ma ade a ahonhon me no adwonnwom ansa na wɔayɛ me oprehyɛn no
The side effects would be the usual complete hair loss nausea vomiting and low blood count
Ɔhaw ahorow a na ebefi mu aba no yɛ ade koro no ara me ti nhwi nyinaa a ebetutu abofono ɛfe ne me mogya a ɛso bɛtew
At first I was depressed but then I began to pray to Jehovah a lot and this strengthened me
Mfiase no mebotowee nanso mifii ase bɔɔ Yehowa mpae pii na eyi hyɛɛ me den
Graduation was less than six months away
Na ennu asram asia na mawie sukuu
My teachers were understanding and kind they just asked that I provide a doctor s note and that I try to keep up with my schoolwork
Na m’atikyafo no wɔ ntease na wɔn yam ye nea na wɔhwehwɛ ara ne sɛ megye krataa afi dɔkta hɔ akɔma wɔn na mabɔ mmɔden atoa me sukuu adesua so
School Was Not Easy	Na Sukuu Nyɛ Mmerɛw
Besides the challenge I had of doing classwork when I was so sick my hair began to fall out
Nea na ɛka asɛnnennen a mihyiae wɔ sukuu adesua a misuae wɔ bere a na meyare yiye ho no ne me ti nhwi a efii ase tutui
When I bought a wig schoolmates said my hair looked great they didn t realize that it was a wig
Bere a metɔɔ weegye no sukuufo no kae sɛ me ti nhwi dɔɔso wɔanhu sɛ na ɛyɛ weegye
However one boy did
Nanso abarimaa bi hui
Every time I walked into the classroom he would spell the word wig on the blackboard and he and his friends would laugh and make fun
Bere biara a mɛkɔ sukuu dan mu no na ɔkyerɛw asɛmfua weegye gu kyerɛwpon no so na na ɔne ne nnamfo serew me na wodi me ho fɛw
All their teasing made me depressed
Wɔn mfefewayi no nyinaa maa me werɛ howee
Then one day in the crowded hallway someone from behind grabbed the wig off my head
Afei da koro obi fii m’akyi sɔɔ weegye no mu tu fii me ti so bere a na menam nnipadɔm mu wɔ abranaa so
I turned quickly and picked it up
Medanee me ho ntɛm maa so
But dozens of kids saw my bald head and I felt so hurt
Nanso mmofra pii huu me ti ho a atutu no na ɛhaw me yiye
I went to a stairway and cried
Mekɔɔ atrapoe bi so kosui
The next day I could see from some students faces that they felt sorry about what had happened
Da a edi hɔ no mitumi hu fii sukuufo no bi anim sɛ na wɔadi nea esii no ho yaw
Classmates told me that a girl had paid a boy to pull off my wig
Sukuufo a me ne wɔn wɔ ɔdan biako mu no ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ abeawa bi na ɔbɔɔ abarimaa bi paa sɛ ommetu me weegye no
Stand on Blood Not Easy	Mogya ho Asɛm Ano Gyina Nyɛ Mmerɛw
With the chemotherapy my blood count dropped very low
Bere a na wɔma me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no me mogya so tewee yiye
To make matters worse my nose would bleed sometimes two or three times a day
Nea ɛsɛee asɛm no koraa ne me hwenem a na etu mogya a ɛtɔ da bi a na ɛba mprenu anaa mprɛnsa da koro no
I wasn t baptized but I took a firm position and said that as one of Jehovah s Witnesses I would not accept blood
Na wɔmmɔɔ me asu de nanso migyinaa pintinn kae sɛ sɛ Yehowa Adansefo no biako no merennye mogya
My oldest sister encouraged one of my little nieces to tell me that she didn t want me to die
Me nuabea panyin hyɛɛ ne babea ketewaa nkuran sɛ ɔnka nkyerɛ me sɛ ɔmpɛ sɛ miwu
Father was upset demanding that I take blood and Mommy kept telling me that God would forgive me if I took a transfusion
Papa bo fuwii na ɔhyɛe sɛ minnye mogya na Maame kɔɔ so ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ sɛ migye mogya a Onyankopɔn de befiri me
At the same time doctors warned me that with such a low blood count I could have a heart attack or stroke
Bere koro no ara no dɔktafo bɔɔ me kɔkɔ sɛ esiane sɛnea me mogya no nti metumi anya komayare anaasɛ me fa bedwudwo
Since I was determined to stand firm they had me sign a release form saying that if I died they would not be responsible
Esiane sɛ na masi me bo sɛ megyina pintinn nti wɔmaa mede me nsa hyɛɛ krataa bi ase sɛ sɛ miwu a ɛnyɛ wɔn na wɔaku me
Soon I recovered sufficiently to return home and go back to school
Ankyɛ na me ho tɔɔ me sɛnea ɛsɛ ma woyii me kɔɔ fie ma mekɔɔ sukuu bio
However because of my low blood count the doctors decided that I should now take radiation therapy rather than chemotherapy
Nanso esiane sɛ na me mogya so atew nti dɔktafo no sii gyinae sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ saa bere no de wɔde afiri a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa sa me yare mmom sen sɛ wɔbɛma me nnuru a ano yɛ den no
I had these treatments every day after school from late April to early June
Wɔsaa me yare wɔ saa kwan yi so daa biara a mapɔn sukuu no fi April awiei kosii June mfiase
Graduation Then Baptism	Sukuuwie ne Asubɔ
Graduation was a special occasion
Ɛda a miwiee sukuu no yɛ da titiriw
My sister had helped me shop for a dress and I had bought a new wig
Na me nuabea aboa me ma makɔtɔ atade na na matɔ weegye foforo
Mommy and my two sisters were there and afterward we went out together for a memorable meal
Na Maame ne me nuabeanom baanu wɔ hɔ na ɛno akyi no yɛboom pue kodii aduan bi a me werɛ remfi da
At the time I was not receiving chemotherapy or radiation
Saa bere no na wɔmma me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no na na wɔmfa me nhyɛ afiri a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no mu
But a few weeks later the doctor called and said to come into the hospital for another cycle of chemotherapy
Nanso adapɛn kakraa bi akyi no dɔkta no frɛe wɔ telefon so kae sɛ memmra ayaresabea hɔ na wɔmma me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no bio
I didn t want to go because in one week I would be attending the district convention of Jehovah s Witnesses at Yankee Stadium in New York City
Na mempɛ sɛ mekɔ efisɛ na merebɛkɔ Yehowa Adansefo ɔmantam nhyiam wɔ Yankee Agumadibea wɔ New York City dapɛn a edi hɔ no
However Mommy said to go ahead and get the treatments over with
Nanso Maame kae sɛ menkɔ nkɔyɛ aduru no mma emfi me so
So I did
Enti mekɔe
I was very excited during the convention because on Saturday July I was going to be baptized
M’ani gyee yiye wɔ nhyiam no ase efisɛ na wɔrebɛbɔ me asu Memeneda July
We had a police escort to Orchard Beach the baptism site
Polisifo dii yɛn akyi kɔɔ Orchard Beach beae a wɔbɛbɔ yɛn asu no
After being baptized I returned to the stadium for the rest of the day s program
Bere a wɔbɔɔ me asu wiei no mesan kɔɔ agumadibea hɔ kotiee ɛda no dwumadi nkae no
I felt very tired that evening but Sunday morning I got ready and attended the last day of the convention

Facing the Blood Issue Again	Mihyia Mogya ho Asɛm Bio
The following afternoon I was hospitalized with a fever of degrees Fahrenheit C
a kidney infection and an extremely low blood count
Ɛda a edi hɔ awiabere no wogyee me too ayaresabea a na me ho ayɛ hyew yiye a m’asaabo ho aka na me mogya so atew kɛse koraa
The doctor threatened that if I didn t sign the consent form for a transfusion he would get a court order and force blood on me
Dɔkta no hunahunaa me sɛ sɛ mamfa me nsa anhyɛ krataa bi ase sɛ megye mogya a ɔbɛkɔ akogye tumi krataa afi asennibea na wahyɛ me ama me mogya
I was very scared
Ehu kaa me kɛse
My family was pressuring me my sister even offered to give me some of her blood but I told her no
Na m’abusuafo no rehyɛ me so me nuabea mpo kae sɛ ɔbɛtwe ne mogya ama me nanso meka kyerɛɛ no sɛ mempɛ
I prayed a lot to Jehovah to help me to stand firm
Mebɔɔ Yehowa mpae pii sɛ ɔmmoa me ma minnyina pintinn
Thankfully my blood count began rising and the pressure to take blood ceased
Nea ɛyɛ anigye ne sɛ me mogya fii ase kɔɔ soro na wanhyɛ me bio sɛ wɔbɛma me mogya
Although I needed to continue chemotherapy I had no suitable veins left
Ɛwom sɛ na ehia sɛ wɔkɔ so ma me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no de nanso na ntini a ɛfata biara nni me ho a wobetumi de nnuru afa mu
So a surgeon made a small opening below my collarbone to insert a device through which medication could be given
Enti dɔkta bi tuu tokuru wɔ me kɔn ase dompe ase de biribi hyɛɛ hɔ a wobetumi de nnuru afa mu
When discussing the removal of the tumors in my lung the surgeon said he would not use blood except in an emergency
Bere a yɛresusuw ade a ahonhon m’ahurututu mu ho yi no dɔkta no kae sɛ ɔremma me mogya gye sɛ tebea no mu yɛ den
Mommy was telling me to give approval so I did
Maame ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ mempene so enti migye toom
But afterward I felt bad because in effect that was agreeing to accept blood
Nanso ɛno akyi no ɛhawee me efisɛ na ɛno kyerɛ sɛ merepene so sɛ megye mogya
Right away I began searching for a surgeon who would guarantee not to use blood
Amonom hɔ ara mifii ase hwehwɛɛ dɔkta foforo a ɔbɛma me awerɛhyem sɛ ɔremma me mogya
The search seemed hopeless but I finally found one and the surgery was scheduled for January
Ɛyɛɛ te sɛ nea na anidaso biara nnim sɛ menya obi nanso awiei koraa no minyaa obi na wɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ wɔbɛyɛ me oprehyɛn no wɔ January mu
The doctor gave no assurance I would live
Dɔkta no amma me awerɛhyem biara sɛ menya nkwa
In fact the night before the operation he came to my room and said I will try to do the procedure
Nokwarem no anadwo ansa na wɔrebɛyɛ oprehyɛn no ɔbaa me dan mu na ɔkae sɛ Mɛbɔ mmɔden afa saa kwan no so
I was scared I was only and didn t want to die
Mebɔɔ hu na madi mfe pɛ na na mempɛ sɛ miwu
However the three tumors were successfully removed as well as two thirds of my lung
Nanso wotumi yii ade abiɛsa a na ahonhon me no ne m’ahurututu mu nkyem abiɛsa mu abien a asiane biara ansi
Remarkably I was in the hospital for only a week
Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ne sɛ medaa ayaresabea hɔ dapɛn biako pɛ
After recovering at home for about two and a half months I again began chemotherapy with the usual side effects
Bere a mekɔdaa fie asram abien maa me ho tɔɔ me no wofii ase maa me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no bio na mihyiaa ɛho ɔhaw ahorow koro no ara
About this time my father also became sick with cancer and one night a few months later Mommy found him dead in the bedroom
Me papa bɛyaree kokoram saa bere yi ara mu na asram kakraa bi akyi anadwo bi no Maame hui sɛ wawu da piam
After his death I started going to a trade school where I took up secretarial training
Ne wu akyi no mifii ase kɔɔ nsaanodwuma sukuu bi kosuaa ɔkyerɛwfo adwuma
I was doing well physically academically and spiritually even sharing as an auxiliary pioneer temporary full time minister

Yet Another Setback	Akwanside Foforo Bio
In April I attended my oldest brother s wedding reception in Augusta Georgia
Wɔ April mu no mekɔɔ me nuabarima panyin paa ayeforohyia adidi ase wɔ Augusta Georgia
While there my brother said Your leg is really big
Bere a mewɔ hɔ no me nua no kae sɛ Wo nan ayɛ kɛse dodo
What do you think it is ? I asked
Mibisae sɛ Wususuw sɛ ɛyɛ dɛn ? 
 I don t know he answered
Obuae sɛ Minnim
It s probably a tumor I said
Mekae sɛ Ebia ade na ahon hɔ
After returning to New York City I went to the doctor
Bere a mesan kɔɔ New York City no mikohuu dɔkta no
A biopsy performed under local anesthesia revealed another Wilms tumor in my left calf
Ɛdaa adi wɔ nhwehwɛmu a ɛhɔnom ɔyarehwɛfo a ɔma ayarefo nnuru ma wɔda nnahɔɔ no yɛe mu sɛ biribi a wɔfrɛ no Wilm ahon me nantu
Tests revealed that the bone was not affected but the tumor was too big to take out
Nhwehwɛmu daa no adi sɛ ɛnkaa me dompe no nanso na ade a ahon me no so dodo sɛ wobeyi
So the usual chemotherapy followed
Enti wɔmaa me nnuru a ano yɛ den a ekunkum ɔyare mmoawa no ara
After a while I couldn t stop vomiting I had an intestinal blockage
Bere bi akyi no na mintumi nnyae fe me nsono famee
An emergency operation relieved it

I believed that once asked no one would ever refuse
Na misusuw sɛ sɛ wɔka sɛ obi nyɛ mmoa a obiara rempopo ne ti da
Well I m here to tell you that I have been the caregiver for my parents for over ten years and when I asked my siblings for help they wouldn t provide it
Nanso mereka akyerɛ mo sɛ me na mahwɛ m’awofo bɛboro mfe du ni na sɛ meka kyerɛ me nuanom sɛ wɔmmɛboa a wɔnyɛ
We live in a cold uncaring world

The Scriptures say that caring for family members is an obligation for Christians
Kyerɛwnsɛm no ka sɛ abusua mufo a wɔbɛhwɛ wɔn no yɛ asɛyɛde ma Kristofo
If anyone does not provide for those who are his own and especially for those who are members of his household he has disowned the faith

I really appreciated the advice to make time for your mate and for yourself
M’ani sɔɔ afotu a ese ɛsɛ sɛ wunya bere ma wo hokafo ne wo ho no kɛse
I have failed to do this in the past feeling that care of our parents came before time with my husband or time for myself

Can Family Life Be Happier Without TV ?	So Abusua Asetra Betumi Ayɛ Anigye Kɛse Bere a Wonni TV ?
IN FEBRUARY this year The Wall Street Journal featured the article Going Tubeless Some Families Flourish Without TV
WƆ AFE yi February mu no The Wall Street Journal kaa asɛm yi Television a Wogyae Hwɛ Mmusua Bi Di Yiye a Wonni TV
The paper reported For the relative handful of American families who unplug for good life after television goes on quite happily at that
Krataa no bɔɔ amanneɛ sɛ Amerikafo mmusua kakra a wogyae television hwɛ koraa fam no asetra kɔ so bere a wogyae hwɛ no akyi wɔ anigye kɛse mu
Television s effect on the family was also discussed recently at a reunion to celebrate the th anniversary of the first sub four minute mile which was run by Roger Bannister
Wosusuw tumi a television nya wɔ abusua no so nso ho nnansa yi wɔ nkabom nhyiam bi a wɔde hyɛɛ bere a edi kan a wɔde simma a ennu anan tuu mmirika twaa akwansin biako a Roger Bannister na ɔyɛɛ saa no mfe ho fa no ase
According to Jim Ryun a champion miler in the s the subject came up during dinner with Roger before the Olympics
Sɛnea Jim Ryun nea na okura kwansin biako mmirikatu ho nkonimbo wɔ mfe no mu kyerɛ no asɛm no sɔree bere a na ɔne Roger redidi anwummere bi ansa na wɔrefi Olimpik no ase no
My wife Anne and I were engaged to be married at the time Ryun explained so Roger told us he had discovered something that really improved the quality of his family life
Ryun kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ Na me ne me yere Anne ayɛ nhyehyɛe rebɛware saa bere no enti Roger ka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ wahu biribi a ɛmaa n’abusua asetra yɛɛ papa ankasa
Of course we were all ears
Nokwarem no yɛyɛɛ komm tiei
He said what he had done is taken the television out of the house so that had given them more time as a family to be together to talk to read together
Ɔkae sɛ nea na wayɛ ne sɛ wayi television no afi fie hɔ enti ama wɔanya bere pii de yɛ ade bom sɛ abusua wɔbɔ nkɔmmɔ na wɔkenkan ade bom
Ryun related What he said had a major impact on us
Ryun kae sɛ Nea ɔkae no nyaa yɛn so tumi kɛse
We began realizing We don t really need a TV
Yefii ase hui sɛ yenhia TV ankasa
’ 
A number of people have reached the same conclusion
Nnipa dodow bi asi gyinae a ɛte saa ara
Why ?	Dɛn ntia ?
Because of the mesmerizing effect that TV can have especially on the young
Ɛyɛ tumi a ɛyɛ nwonwa a TV tumi nya wɔ nkurɔfo ne titiriw mmofra so no ntia
According to a mother in Maryland U
S
A
when nursing her infant daughter in front of the TV the baby would whip her head away from me and stare fixated at the screen
Sɛnea ɛna bi a ɔwɔ Maryland U
S
A
kyerɛ no sɛ ɔrema ne babea ketewaa nufu wɔ TV no anim a akokoaa no gyae me hwɛ kɔhwɛ TV no haa
We figured if she was doing it at that age what would she do when she got older ? 	Yesusuw ho sɛ sɛ ɔreyɛ saa bere a ɔyɛ abofra ketewaa yi a ɛnde dɛn na ɔbɛyɛ bere a wanyin no ? 
So the family got rid of their TV
Enti abusua no gyaee wɔn TV no hwɛ
If you do not eliminate TV entirely does not at least controlling its use make good sense ?	Sɛ wunnyae TV hwɛ koraa a so anyɛ yiye koraa no nyansa nnim sɛ wobɛtew ne hwɛ so ?
Karen Stevenson the first black woman to receive a Rhodes Scholarship for study at Oxford University in England said of her earlier life No television was allowed during the week
Karen Stevenson obibini bea a odi kan a onyaa Rhodes Nhomasua mu mmoa a ɛma okosuaa ade wɔ Oxford Sukuupɔn a ɛwɔ England mu no kaa ne mmofraase ho asɛm sɛ Wɔamma yɛanhwɛ television wɔ dapɛn no mu
If there was something we especially wanted to see
we had to talk to mother about it the Sunday before and plan for it
Sɛ na biribi titiriw wɔ so a yɛpɛ sɛ yɛhwɛ a
na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛne maame ka ho asɛm Kwasida ansa na yɛayɛ ho nhyehyɛe
What about TV viewing in your family ?	TV hwɛ wɔ mo abusua no mu nso ɛ ?
Do you see the value of limiting it or even eliminating it for a time ?	So muhu sɛ mfaso wɔ so sɛ mobɛtew so anaasɛ mubegyae hwɛ akosi bere bi ?

The nurse said she had shared the tract with her husband and that they had read it together appreciatively
Ɔyarehwɛfo no kae sɛ ɔde kratawa no kyerɛɛ ne kunu na wɔboom kenkan no anigye so
In fact the nurse said they could not believe something so positive was available to help families
Nokwarem no ɔyarehwɛfo no kae sɛ na onnye nni sɛ biribi pa saa wɔ hɔ a wɔde boa mmusua ahorow
The patient explained The nurse told me that the information was exactly what she and her husband had been discussing in terms of ideal and positive things in the family but that they had no idea anything on the subject was available in printed form

A Big Dream Fulfilled !	Dae Titiriw Bi Abam !
BY AWAKE !	EFI NYAN !
CORRESPONDENT IN NIGERIA	KYERƐWFO A ƆWƆ NIGERIA HƆ
OVER Witnesses were at the noon meal at the Bethel Home in Nigeria on February when the waiters wheeled in the ice cream for dessert
NA ADANSEFO bɛboro redidi awiabere wɔ Betel Fie wɔ Nigeria wɔ February na wɔn a wɔkyekyɛ aduan no piaa ice cream a esisi trɔk nkumaa bi so a wobedi no sɛ nnɔkɔnnɔkɔwade baa mu
What is the occasion ? some wondered aloud
Ebinom bisae sɛ Dɛn na ɛrekɔ so nnɛ ?
 Not only ice cream but such a variety vanilla chocolate strawberry and pistachio ! 	Ɛnyɛ ice cream kɛkɛ na wɔde bae na mmom nea nneɛma a ne dɛ gu ahorow wom vanilla chocolate strawberry ne pistachio ! 
 Four color ice cream !	Nea na ɔte didipon ti no de too gua sɛ Ice cream a ne kɔla yɛ anan !
It has a special significance announced the one presiding at the meal
Ɛkyerɛ biribi titiriw
It is to celebrate our change to four color full color printing ! 	Yɛde rehyɛ nhoma a wɔde kɔla anan na ɛyɛ emu mfonini kɔla ahorow tintim no ho fa ! 
The thunderous applause that followed was not simply for the ice cream in the dining room
Ɛnyɛ ice cream no a na ɛwɔ adididan no mu nti na wɔbɔɔ wɔn nsam kɛse no
It was in appreciation of the new printing presses in the factory that had already begun to produce the Watchtower and Awake !	Na ɛyɛ nhoma tintim mfiri foforo a ɛwɔ nhoma tintimbea hɔ a na afi ase retintim Ɔwɛn Aban ne Nyan !
magazines in full color
nsɛmma nhoma no mu mfonini wɔ kɔla ahorow mu dedaw no ho anisɔ ntia
Full color printing was now a reality worldwide
Na nhoma a wotintim wɔ kɔla ahorow mu no abɛyɛ botae a wɔadu ho wɔ wiase nyinaa
Nigeria was the last of the large printing branches to be converted to full color printing a move that had got under way in the mid s
Na Nigeria baa dwumadibea no ne nea ɛwɔ nhoma tintimbea kɛse a etwa to a wofii ase tintim nhoma a wɔde kɔla ahorow yɛ emu mfonini nhyehyɛe a efii ase wɔ mfe no mfinimfini no
With the March issue of The Watchtower two color printing had become a thing of the past in Nigeria
Efi March Ɔwɛn Aban no so no wogyaee nhoma a ɛyɛ kɔla abien tintim wɔ Nigeria
The two new Koenig and Bauer Rapida printing presses had come from the Netherlands branch
Wɔde nhoma tintim mfiri foforo abien Koenig ne Bauer Rapida no fi Netherlands baa dwumadibea na ɛbae
Along with the presses came other printing equipment plate scanner folder stitcher trimmer and sheeter
Wɔde mfiri afoforo a ɛboa ma wotintim nhoma kaa nhoma tintim mfiri no ho bae afiri bi a wɔfrɛ no plate scanner nea wɔde bobɔ nhoma nea wɔde pam nea wɔde tenetene ano ne nea wɔde twitwa nkrataa
In all it amounted to metric tons of equipment
Sɛ wɔka nneɛma no mu duru nyinaa bom a na esi mɛtrik tɔn
Printing Presses That Float on Air !	Nhoma Tintim Mfiri a Ɛtɛn Mframa Ani !
With the decision to send the presses came the problem of how to ship them
Bere a wosii gyinae sɛ wɔde nhoma tintim mfiri no asɛnnennen a ɛsɔree ne sɛnea wɔde bɛkɔ
Thirty five ton presses do not fit in a suitcase !	Na afiri a emu duru yɛ tɔn aduasa anum renkɔ adaka ketewaa bi mu !
Bernd Sauerbier who organized the shipping from the Netherlands said We had to think about how to transport the machines in the best way to protect them from damage
Bernd Sauerbier a ɔyɛɛ mfiri no a wɔde befi Netherlands afa po so aba ho nhyehyɛe no kae sɛ Na ɛsɛ sɛ yesusuw sɛnea yɛde mfiri no bɛkɔ no ho wɔ ɔkwampa a ɛbɛma yɛabɔ ho ban na ansɛe so
Normally such presses are shipped in huge wooden crates
Mpɛn pii no wɔde nhoma tintim mfiri a ɛtete saa no gu nnua nnaka akɛse mu na wɔde afa po so hyɛn
However the brothers feared that wood might not be strong enough to withstand the rigors of sea travel along with dockside loading and unloading
Nanso na anuanom no suro sɛ ebia nnua nnaka renyɛ nea ɛwɔ ahoɔden kɛse a ebetumi agyina po so akwantu mu awosoawosow ne sesa a wɔbɛsesa agu po so hyɛn mu wɔ hyɛn gyinabea ne ne yi ano
A cheaper and more secure alternative would be to send them in foot long steel shipping containers
Ɔkwan foforo a na ahobammɔ wom sen biara na ɛmmɔ ka kɛse a na wobetumi afa so de akɔ ne sɛ wɔde begu dade nnaka a ne tenten yɛ anammɔn mu
But how do you move such huge machines in and out of containers ?	Nanso na wɔbɛyɛ dɛn apia mfiri akɛse yi akɔhyɛ nnaka no mu na wɔayi ?
Brother Sauerbier said This was a challenge because we had no experience in loading printing presses into containers
Onua Sauerbier kae sɛ Na eyi yɛ asɛm efisɛ na yenni nhoma tintim mfiri a wɔde gu dade nnaka mu mena ho osuahu biara
Even the company that manufactured the presses had no idea how to ship them in this way
Na adwumakuw a wɔyɛɛ mfiri no mpo nnim sɛnea wɔde mfiri bɛmena wɔ saa kwan yi so
The solution involved the use of air cushions also known as air filled modules
Sumii a wɔpɔmpe mframa gu mu na na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma
These air cushions are unimpressive to look at but they do a mighty work
Saa sumii a wɔpɔmpe mframa gu mu no nsɛ biribi titiriw bi nanso edi dwuma kɛse
They are flat units made of aluminum and rubber somewhat larger and heavier than a briefcase
Ɛyɛ biribi ntraantraa a wɔde aluminum ne rɔba ayɛ a ne kɛse ne emu duru sen adaka a wɔde kura kakra
Compressed air is pumped through them and is propelled downward
Wɔpɔmpe mframa gu mu na wosi ne ti ase
This lifts the air cushions slightly above the ground along with whatever rests on them
Eyi ma sumii no ma ne ho so fi fam na ɛpagyaw biribiara a esi so
In this way even the units of a printing press weighing many tons can be supported on a thin cushion of air
Wɔ saa kwan yi so no wotumi de nhoma tintim afiri afa horow a emu duru yɛ tɔn pii no mpo sisi sumii nketewa a mframa gyina mu no so
They hover floating on air !	Ɛsensɛn hɔ anaasɛ ɛtɛn mframa ani !
Once a unit is lifted off the ground it is easy to push it by hand to wherever you want it
Sɛ afiri no fa bi nya ma ne ho so fi fam a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wode wo nsa bepia akɔ baabiara a wopɛ sɛ wode kɔ
The Witnesses laid hardboard on the floor of the containers so that it would be smooth enough to use air cushions inside them
Adansefo no de ntaaboo a ɛyɛ den beabeaa nnaka no ase sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛhɔ bɛda so ma wɔatumi de sumii no atoto mu
They also had to make sure that the floor of each container was absolutely flat
Na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhwɛ hu sɛ nnaka no mu biara ase da so koraa nso
Once the machines were inside the containers the brothers fixed steel rods to the sides and the top of each container to make the cargo more secure
Bere a wɔde mfiri no sisii nnaka no mu wiei no anuanom de nnade nteaanteaa atenten hyehyɛɛ adaka biara nkyɛn nkyɛn ne soro na ama nneɛma no agyina faako pintinn
It took two weeks in August to load all the units into the containers
Egyee adapɛn abien na wɔde hyehyɛɛ mfiri no afa horow nyinaa guu nnaka no mu wɔ August mu
On December at p
m
the first five containers arrived at the Nigeria Bethel complex
Nnaka anum a edi kan no duu Nigeria Betel hɔ December anwummere
The brothers were waiting eager and ready to begin the exacting work of off loading
Na anuanom retwɛn a wɔn ho pere wɔn na wɔayɛ krado sɛ wobefi nneɛma no yi a na ɛyɛ den no ase
They worked through the night until daybreak
Wɔyɛɛ adwuma anadwo no nyinaa kosii adekyee
Since the machinery had been packed on air cushions workers pumped in pressurized air and piece by piece the units glided out of the containers
Esiane sɛ na wɔde mfiri no asisi sumii a wɔpɔmpe mframa gu mu so nti adwumayɛfo no pɔmpee mframa guu mu na mfiri afa no fifii nnaka no mu mmiako mmiako
Cranes then lifted each unit onto a specially built platform at the factory entrance
Afei wɔde ahoɔden mansa momaa mfiri no afa horow no so sisii apa bi a wɔahyɛ da ayɛ so wɔ nhoma tintimbea dan no ano
Again the air cushions were put to work and as a crowd of enthusiastic onlookers watched the machines were pushed by hand to where they would operate
Wɔde sumii no dii dwuma bio na bere a nnipadɔm de anigye rehwɛ no wɔde nsa piapiaa mfiri no kosisii mmeae a ɛbɛyɛ adwuma no
Delighted Reaction to Full Color Magazines	Ahurusi a Wodi wɔ Nsɛmma Nhoma a Wɔde Kɔla Ahorow Ayɛ Emu Mfonini no Ho
At p
m
on February the presses turned out the first English language full color Watchtower printed in Nigeria
Nhoma tintim mfiri no tintimii Engiresi kasa mu Ɔwɛn Aban a wɔde kɔla ahorow ayɛ emu mfonini a edi kan wɔ Nigeria February anwummere
Soon the presses were also printing magazines in Yoruba Igbo Efik and French
Ankyɛ na nhoma tintim mfiri no fii ase tintim nsɛmma nhoma wɔ Yoruba Igbo Efik ne Franse kasa mu nso
As the first copies became available to those living at Bethel what was the reaction ?	Bere a wɔn a wɔwɔ Betel no nsa kaa nsɛmma nhoma a edi kan a wotintimii no bi no dɛn na wɔyɛe ?
 I was elated ! exclaimed one
Obiako kae sɛ Midii ahurusi !
 Its attractiveness surpasses by far any other publication produced in this country
Ɛyɛ fɛ sen nhoma foforo biara a wɔatintim wɔ ɔman yi mu koraa
Another said Just as soon as they were available I obtained copies which I mailed to my family and friends
Ɔfoforo kae sɛ Bere a ɛbae araa pɛ na migyee mmiako mmiako menaa m’abusuafo ne me nnamfo
I can t wait to use them in the field
Me ho peree me sɛ mede bedi dwuma wɔ asɛnka mu
Still another when asked how she felt about the new full color magazines replied Just splendid !	Afei nso bere a wobisaa ɔfoforo sɛnea ɔtee nka wɔ nsɛmma nhoma ahorow a wɔde kɔla ahorow ayɛ emu mfonini ho no ɔkae sɛ Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye !
This is another evidence that Jehovah cares for everybody worldwide ! 	Eyi yɛ adanse foforo a ɛkyerɛ sɛ Yehowa dwen nnipa a wɔwɔ wiase nyinaa mu biara ho ! 
So as the workers at Bethel savored their four color ice cream they thought about full color magazines
Enti bere a Betel adwumayɛfo no dii wɔn ice cream a ɛyɛ kɔla anan no na wɔredwen nsɛmma nhoma ahorow a wɔde kɔla ahorow na ayɛ mu mfonini no nso ho
It was as one expressed it a big dream fulfilled
Sɛnea obi kae no na ɛyɛ dae titiriw bi a abam

Missionaries What Should They Be ?	Asɛmpatrɛwfo Nnipa Bɛn na Ɛsɛ sɛ Wɔyɛ ?
THE word missionary can evoke strong emotions
ASƐMFUA asɛmpatrɛw no betumi akanyan nkate a emu yɛ den
In some people it inspires admiration calling to mind individuals like Mother Teresa or the late Albert Schweitzer
Ɛma ebinom nya obu bi na wɔkae nnipa bi te sɛ Mother Teresa anaa Albert Schweitzer a waka baabi no
In contrast others react with indifference disgust or even anger when the subject of missionaries is broached
Nea ɛne eyi bɔ abira no sɛ wɔbɔ asɛmpatrɛwfo asɛm so a afoforo mmu no ahiasɛm ɛyɛ wɔn abofono anaasɛ wɔn bo fuw mpo
To them the word suggests mental manipulation and conjures up visions of colonialism
Wɔn fam no asɛmfua no kyerɛ afoforo adwene a wɔnam nnɛɛdɛɛ so di so na ɛde wɔn adwene kɔ hyɛ a wɔhyɛ nnipa so de wɔn yɛ nkoa so
As regards missionaries an appropriate question is Have they been agents of light or agents of darkness ?	Asɛm a ɛfata sɛ yebisa wɔ asɛmpatrɛwfo ho ne sɛ So wɔada wɔn ho adi sɛ hann adwumayɛfo anaasɛ esum de ?
What Is a Missionary ?	Ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo Adwuma ne Dɛn ?
A missionary is defined as a person undertaking a mission that is to say undertaking a ministry commissioned by a religious organization to propagate its faith or carry on humanitarian work
Wɔkyerɛ ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo ase sɛ obi a okura asɛm bi kyerɛ sɛ okura ɔsom adwuma a nyamesom ahyehyɛde bi de ahyɛ ne nsa sɛ ɔmmɔ ne gyidi ho dawuru anaa ɔnyɛ asetram nneɛma a nnipa hia ho adwuma
The basis for Christian missionary work was provided by Jesus Christ when he told his followers Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations
Yesu Kristo na ɔde Kristofo asɛmpatrɛw adwuma ho nnyinasosɛm mae bere a ɔkaa eyi kyerɛɛ n’akyidifo no Enti monkɔ nkɔyɛ amanaman nyinaa m’asuafo
This necessitates preaching the Christian message in the entire world
Matthew
Eyi ama ɛho abehia sɛ wɔka asɛm a Kristofo kura no wɔ wiase nyinaa
Mateo
Jesus himself was a missionary sent by his Father Jehovah from heaven to a foreign assignment the earth
Na Yesu ankasa yɛ ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo a n’Agya Yehowa somaa no fii soro baa amanɔnne asase so bɛyɛɛ adwuma
Logically a Christian missionary should closely follow the example set by Jesus Christ
Ɛfata sɛ Kristoni ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo di nhwɛso a Yesu Kristo yɛe no akyi pɛpɛɛpɛ
A first century missionary who did just that was the apostle Paul who became a model for subsequent Christian missionaries to imitate
Corinthians
Afeha a edi kan no mu ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo a ɔyɛɛ saa pɛpɛɛpɛ ne ɔsomafo Paulo a ɔbɛyɛɛ nhwɛsofo a ɛsɛ sɛ Kristofo asɛmpatrɛwfo a wodi n’akyi no suasua no
Korintofo
Although sympathetic to the social problems plaguing humankind Jesus did not give top priority to solving them while on earth
Ɛwom sɛ na Yesu wɔ tema ma adesamma wɔ ɔhaw ahorow a wɔrehyia no ho de nanso bere a na ɔwɔ asase so no wamma ɛno ho dwuma a na obedi no anhia no ansen biribiara
To have done so would only have brought temporary relief at best
Sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa maa ɛde ahotɔ bae mpo a anka ɛbɛyɛ bere tiaa mu ade
Something else was of greater importance
Na biribi foforo ho hia sen saa
For this I have been born and for this I have come into the world Jesus told Pilate that I should bear witness to the truth
Yesu ka kyerɛɛ Pilato sɛ Eyi nti na wɔwoo me na mebaa wi yi ase sɛ merebedi nokware no ho adanse
The value of having a knowledge of such truth cannot be overemphasized as Jesus had earlier stated in prayer This means everlasting life their taking in knowledge of you the only true God and of the one whom you sent forth Jesus Christ
John
Sɛnea na Yesu adi kan aka wɔ mpaebɔ mu no wontumi mmu ani ngu ɛbo a saa nokware no ho nimdeɛ a wobenya no som no so Eyi ne daa nkwa sɛ wobehu wo nokware Nyankopɔn koro no ne nea wosomaa no Yesu Kristo no
’ Yohane
Have Christendom s missionaries measured up to the example set by Jesus ?	So Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo no adi nhwɛso a Yesu yɛe no akyi pɛpɛɛpɛ ?

The answer to these questions should be of interest to all of us because the fruitage produced by professed Christian missionaries over the centuries helps us to identify true religion as well as false religion

How Have Missionaries Measured Up ?	Asɛmpatrɛwfo Ayɛ Wɔn Ade Dɛn ?
Missionaries have made valuable contributions in spreading Christ s message
Asɛmpatrɛwfo anya kyɛfa kɛse wɔ Kristo asɛm no a wɔatrɛw mu no mu
For example some have translated the Bible into local languages thus enabling people to read it for themselves
Sɛ nhwɛso no ebinom akyerɛ Bible no ase akɔ ɔmanfo kasa horow mu ma nkurɔfo tumi kenkan
Nowadays however it appears that some missionaries feel meeting social needs should take precedence over the endeavors of preaching or translating
Nanso nnansa yi ɛte sɛ nea asɛmpatrɛwfo binom te nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wodi nneɛma a nnipa hia wɔ asetram no ho dwuma kan ansa na asɛnka ne nsɛm asekyerɛ aba
An article in Time magazine entitled The New Missionary noted Among Protestants there has been a shift toward greater involvement with the basic economic and social problems of the people the missionaries are trying to reach

As for Catholics the head of Jesuit missions sent from the United States said that the sharing of Christian beliefs has taken second place to being of service to human beings

And a Catholic mission secretary argued In the past we had the so called motive of saving souls

Now thanks be to God we believe that all people and all religions are already living in the grace and love of God and will be saved by God s mercy

Missionaries Who Should Set the Pattern ?	Asɛmpatrɛwfo Hena na Ɛsɛ sɛ Ɔyɛ Nhwɛsode No ?
BEFORE Jesus Christ commanded his followers to make disciples other religions had already been carrying on a missionary activity of sorts
ANSA na Yesu Kristo rehyɛ n’akyidifo sɛ wɔnyɛ asuafo no na ɔsom afoforo bi reyɛ asɛmpatrɛw adwuma bi dedaw
Some did this more than others since not all religions have a universal approach that is not all teach a message felt to apply equally to all peoples
Ebinom yɛɛ no kɛse sen afoforo efisɛ ɛnyɛ ɔsom nyinaa na wɔn ani si nnipa a wɔwɔ mmaa nyinaa so kyerɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn nyinaa na wɔkyerɛkyerɛ asɛm a wɔte nka sɛ ɛfa nnipa nyinaa ho
For example according to The Encyclopedia of Religion such a universal vision is less pronounced in the beliefs of the tribal religions and Shinto and less overt in many strands of Confucianism Judaism and Zoroastrianism
Sɛ nhwɛso no sɛnea The Encyclopedia of Religion kyerɛ no ani a wɔde si nnipa a wɔwɔ mmaa nyinaa so yi nna adi kɛse wɔ mmusua som ahorow ne Shintosom mu na ɛnna adi kɛse wɔ Konfusiosom Yudasom ne Soroastasom ahorow pii mu
These religions are spread more by the migrations of peoples or by the gradual incorporation of immediate neighbors than by organized missionary activities

Hinduism represents a special and exceedingly complex case the encyclopedia adds
Encyclopedia no de ka ho sɛ Hindusom yɛ nhwɛso soronko a asete yɛ den yiye
While it is similar to nonmissionizing traditions in many respects having spread by gradual adoption by non Hindus it has on the other hand had periods of vigorous missionary activity
Ɛwom sɛ ɛne ɔsom ahorow a edi amanne akyi a wɔnyɛ asɛmpatrɛw adwuma di nsɛ wɔ akwan pii so na ɛnam nnipa a wɔnyɛ Hindufo a wɔagye wɔn abam nkakankakra so atrɛw de nanso ɛde ne ho ahyɛ asɛmpatrɛw dwumadi mu denneennen wɔ mmere ahorow bi mu
Those living religions claiming the most universalistic visions and evidencing the most extensive missionary zeal beyond the place of origin says Max L

Islam s missionaries could not have served as patterns for Christian missionaries however because the Islamic era did not begin until some years after Christ s command to make disciples

A Pattern of Liberality	Nneɛma Hokwan a Wɔma ho Nhwɛso
Tradition claims that the Buddha instigated a missionary movement by telling his disciples Go monks preach the noble Doctrine

In most cases the religion was spread on an individual level by traveling traders pilgrims or students
Mpɛn pii no ankorankoro bi a wɔyɛ aguadifo akwantufo anaa nhomasuafo na wɔmaa ɔsom no trɛwee
It reached China and the various parts of Southeast Asia for example through trade routes by sea and by land
Sɛ nhwɛso no ɛnam aguade a wɔde faa po ne asase kesee so kɔɔ amanɔnne so duu China ne Asia Kesee Fam Apuei afa horow
Erik Zurcher of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands attributes the spread of Buddhism mainly to three factors
Erik Zurcher a ɔwɔ Leiden Sukuupɔn a ɛwɔ Netherlands no kyerɛ sɛ nneɛma abiɛsa titiriw na ama Buddhasom atrɛw
One is Buddhism s liberal attitude toward all religions
Emu biako ne ɔsom ahorow nyinaa a wɔma hokwan wɔ Buddhasom mu
This allowed easy acceptance of non Buddhist creeds as preliminary and partial revelations of truth and even the incorporation of non Buddhist deities into its pantheon
Eyi maa ɛyɛɛ mmerɛw sɛ wɔbɛpene gyidikasɛm a emfi Buddhasom mu so sɛ ɛyɛ nokware adiyi mfiase anaa ne fa bi na wogyee anyame a enni Buddhasom mu kaa wɔn anyame ho mpo
A second factor is that Buddhist missionaries entered into a so called homeless state which means they renounced all worldly distinctions
Nea ɛto so abien ne sɛ Buddhafo asɛmpatrɛwfo kɔɔ nea wɔtaa frɛ no gyinabea pɔtee a wonni mu a ɛkyerɛ sɛ wɔpow wiase mpaapaemu nyinaa
Free from the limitations of the caste system whose religious significance the Buddha rejected they could mingle with foreigners without fear of ritual pollution
Esiane sɛ Buddha no pow nyamesom ahorow nnyinasosɛm titiriw a ɛne ɔsom afoforo mufo a wɔne wɔn mmɔ no nti na wonni anohyeto ahorow a ɛwowɔ ɔsom afoforo mu no bi na wotumi ne ahɔho bɔ a wonsuro sɛ wobegu wɔn amanne ahorow ho fi
A third factor is that Buddhism s holy writings were not associated with any one particular sacred language
Nea ɛto so abiɛsa ne sɛ wɔamfa kasa biako pɛ na ɛkyerɛw Buddhasom nkyerɛwee kronkron no
They could easily be translated into any language
Na ɛnyɛ den sɛ wɔbɛkyerɛ ase akɔ kasa biara mu
Especially in China Zurcher notes the most prominent foreign missionaries were all active as translators
Zurcher ka sɛ Wɔ China titiriw no na asɛmpatrɛwfo a wɔyɛ ahɔho a wɔda nsow no nyinaa yɛ nsɛm asekyerɛfo nsiyɛfo
In fact they translated to such an extent that Chinese became a third major language for Buddhist literature joining Pali and Sanskrit
Nokwarem no wɔkyerɛɛ nhoma pii ase araa ma Chinese bɛyɛɛ kasa titiriw a ɛto so abiɛsa a wɔde kyerɛw Buddhafo nhoma na ɛbɛkaa Pali ne Sanskrit kasa ho

Nanso wɔ bere a na Kristosom nnya mfii ase yi mu no India ne nea ɛnnɛ wɔfrɛ hɔ Sri Lanka no titiriw na Buddhasom gyinae
To all intents and purposes it was only after the beginning of the Christian era that Buddhism spread into China Indonesia Iran Japan Korea Malaysia Myanmar Vietnam and elsewhere
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ Kristofo bere no fii ase ansa na Buddhasom retrɛw akɔ China Indonesia Iran Japan Korea Malaysia Myanmar Vietnam ne mmeae afoforo
Buddhism s missionaries to China evidently saw nothing wrong with modifying their religion to make it more acceptable

The Encyclopedia of Religion notes that key Buddhist texts were given fresh interpretation apologetic literature new poems and new laws and regulations were promulgated that modified and indeed transformed aspects of the Buddhist message so that it could graft onto and in some ways revitalize dimensions of the indigenous folk religions and of the Confucianism and Taoism of that land
The Encyclopedia of Religion ka sɛ wɔde nsɛntitiriw a ɛwɔ Buddhafo nkyerɛwee mu ho nkyerɛkyerɛmu foforo mae wɔyeyɛɛ nhoma a wɔde foa nkyerɛkyerɛ so anwensɛm afoforo ne mmara ne ahyɛde afoforo de siesiee Buddhafo nsɛm no afa bi na nokwarem no wɔsakraa bi sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛne ɔmamfo no som ahorow a edi atetesɛm akyi ne Konfusiosom ne Taosom no afa bi bɛyɛ biako na ahyɛ mu den wɔ akwan horow bi so

While they have translated their sacred writings into other languages they have often allowed or even promoted as historian Will Durant states it the absorption of pagan faith and ritual into their religious practices

Following The Master Missionary 	 Ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo Panyin No Akyidi
Judaism and Christian Beginnings explains that Judaism did not promote missionary activity in the same sense that Christianity did but was relatively non proselytizing
Judaism and Christian Beginnings kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Yudasom anhyɛ asɛmpatrɛw dwumadi ho nkuran sɛnea Kristosom yɛe no na mmom sɛ wɔde wɔn toto afoforo ho a na wɔnsakra nkurɔfo nkɔ wɔn som mu kɛse
Yet the book s author Samuel Sandmel notes that there was at least a recurrent at least sporadic thrust toward it
Nanso Samuel Sandmel a ɔyɛ nhoma no kyerɛwfo ka sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no na ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ hɔ a wɔde wɔn adwene kɔ so na anyɛ yiye koraa no na wɔyɛ no bere ne bere mu
Sandmel explains that in the Rabbinic literature Father Abraham is often depicted as the master missionary
Sandmel kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ wɔtaa ka Agya Abraham ho asɛm wɔ Rabifo nhoma ahorow mu sɛ ɔne ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo panyin
He reasons that this view of Abraham as the missionary could scarcely have arisen had there not existed some disposition in at least some segments of Jewry that looked favorably either on an active quest for proselytes or at least on the reception into the faith of those who on their own sought conversion
Ɔkyerɛ sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no sɛ na Yudafo binom ani nnye mmɔden a wɔbɔ de sakra nkurɔfo kɔ wɔn som mu anaa anyɛ hwee mpo no wɔn a wofi wɔn pɛ mu dan kɔ mu no a wobegye wɔn akɔ gyidi no mu ho a anka ɛnyɛ nea wobebu Abraham sɛ ɔyɛ ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo
Evidently during the two centuries immediately preceding the Common Era Jewish missionary activity was intensified particularly in Greek speaking countries as pagan religions began to lose their appeal
Adanse a ɛwɔ hɔ kyerɛ sɛ mfeha abien a edii Yɛn Bere yi anim mu no Yudafo asɛmpatrɛw dwumadi kɔɔ so kɛse wɔ aman a wɔka Hela kasa wɔ hɔ mu titiriw bere a na wɔnkyerɛ abosonsom ho anigye bio no
This activity continued well into the Common Era but was outlawed in the fourth century C

when the Roman Empire adopted a watered down form of Christianity as its official religion
Saa dwumadi yi kɔɔ so araa besii Yɛn Bere yi mu pɛɛ nanso wɔbarae wɔ afeha a ɛto so anan Y
B
mu bere a Roma Ahemman no de Kristosom bi a wɔafra mu sii hɔ sɛ ɔsom a mmara ma kwan no
Setting the Pattern	Nhwɛsode no a Wɔde Si Hɔ
The pattern set by Jewish missionaries however was not what Christian missionaries were told to follow
Nanso ɛnyɛ nhwɛsode a Yudafo asɛmpatrɛwfo de sii hɔ no na wɔka kyerɛɛ Kristofo asɛmpatrɛwfo sɛ wonni akyi
In fact of the Jewish Pharisees of his day Jesus said You scour sea and land to make a single convert and then you make him twice as ripe for destruction as you are yourselves
Nokwarem no Yesu kaa ne bere so Yudafo Farisifo no ho asɛm sɛ Mutwa po ne asase ho hyia sɛ mobɛyɛ onipa biako mo fekuni na sɛ ɔyɛ a moyɛ no amanehunu kuroni mmɔho abien sen mo ankasa
So even though they viewed Abraham as the master missionary Jewish missionaries obviously did not make converts to the kind of faith Abraham had in Jehovah God
Enti ɛmfa ho sɛ Yudafo asɛmpatrɛwfo buu Abraham sɛ ɔne ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo panyin no ɛda adi sɛ wɔannan nkurɔfo ankɔ wɔn som mu amma wɔannya gyidi te sɛ nea na Abraham wɔ wɔ Yehowa Nyankopɔn mu no
For Christian missionaries the pattern to be followed is the perfect example given by the foremost master missionary Jesus Christ
Nhwɛsode a ɛsɛ sɛ Kristofo asɛmpatrɛwfo di akyi ne nhwɛso a ɛyɛ pɛ a Yesu Kristo ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo kunini no de mae no
Well before issuing his disciple making command he began training his early disciples to perform the international missionary activity that this would involve
Bere tenten ansa na ɔde ahyɛde a ɛfa asuafoyɛ ho rema no ofii ase tetee n’asuafo a wodi kan no na wɔayɛ wiase nyinaa asɛmpatrɛw adwuma a na eyi bɛhwehwɛ no
Since it was to be a centuries long project the question was appropriate Would Christ s followers stick to the pattern he had given ?	Esiane sɛ na ɛyɛ adwuma a ebegye mfehaha pii nti na asemmisa yi fata sɛ So na Kristo akyidifo no bɛbata nhwɛsode a ɔde ama no ho ?
As the first century of the Common Era drew to a close the answer was not yet evident
Bere a Yɛn Bere yi mu afeha a edi kan no rekɔ n’awiei no na mmuae no nnya nnaa adi
Not so today as the th century draws to a close
Ɛnte saa nnɛ bere a afeha a ɛto so yi rekɔ n’awiei no
Some years of past missionary activity on the part of professed followers of Christ lie before us as an open book

Charged with practicing the Jewish religion almost all of them were tortured by the Inquisition
Bere a wɔbɔɔ wɔn sobo sɛ wɔredi Yudasom akyi no ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔnam Atirimɔden Asenni no so yɛɛ wɔn nyinaa ayayade
The following sentence pronounced against a member of this family reflects the horror The said Dona Mariana de Carvajal I do condemn to be
given the garrote an instrument of strangulation until she dies naturally and then that she be burned in a blazing fire until she turns to ashes and of her not even the memory remains
Asɛm a edi so yi a wɔde buaa abusua yi muni bi fɔ no da atirimɔdensɛm no adi Mibua Dona Mariana de Carvajal a yɛadi n’asɛm no fɔ sɛ

That is just what happened
Saa pɛpɛɛpɛ na wɔyɛɛ no
Whenever a foreigner threatened the clergy s power he was brought to trial
Bere biara a ɔmamfrani bi maa asɔfo no tumidi ho baa asɛm no wodii n’asɛm
A man named Don Guillen Lombardo de Guzman was accused of wanting to liberate Mexico
Wɔbɔɔ ɔbarima bi a wɔfrɛ no Don Guillen Lombardo de Guzman sobo sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔma Mexico nya ahofadi
However the charge brought by the Holy Office for his arrest and trial was for being an astrologer and sectarian heretic of Calvin
Nanso asɛm a Tumidi Kronkron no gyinaa so de kyeree no dii n’asɛm ne sɛ ɔyɛ nsoromma mu hwɛfo ne ɔwaefo a odi Calvin nkyerɛkyerɛ akyi
During his imprisonment he went out of his mind
Bere a wɔde no too afiase no ɔbɔɔ dam
Finally he was burned alive at the stake on November
Awiei koraa no wɔhyew no anikan so wɔ dua ho wɔ November
The book Inquisition and Crimes by Don Artemio de Valle Arizpe describes that occasion They went tying up the culprits fastening them to the stake with an iron collar around the throat
Nhoma a wɔato din Inquisition and Crimes a Don Artemio de Valle Arizpe kyerɛwee no ka sɛnea adeyɛ no kɔɔ so ho asɛm sɛ Wɔkyekyeree wɔn a wɔabu wɔn fɔ no bɔɔ dua mu de dade sɛn wɔn kɔn
The holy bonfires of the faith began to burn in a whirlwind of red and black
Gyidi ho gyaframa kronkron no fii ase dɛwee ogyaframa ne wusiw a adi afra
Don Guillen
let himself suddenly drop and the collar that was holding him by the neck strangled him his body disappearing afterward in the horrifying splendor of the blaze
Don Guillen
gyaee ne ho hwee ogya no mu prɛko pɛ maa nea ɛsɛn ne kɔn no miaa no kum no na ogya a ano yɛ den a ɛyɛ hu no hyew ne nipadua dwerɛbee
He left this life after seventeen years of slow and continuous suffering in the somber jails of the Holy Office
Ofii nkwa mu bere a na wakɔ so ahu amane nkakrankakra mfe dunson wɔ Tumidi Kronkron no afiase ahorow a ɛhɔ yɛ sum no mu
The bonfires went dying down little by little the cardinal red tumult of their flames fading away and when they became extinguished only a bright pile of embers was left glowing in the night
Ogyaframa no baa fam nkakrankakra maa ne fram a na ano yɛ den a ɛyɛ bruu ne kɔkɔɔ no brɛɛ ase na bere a edumii no nso hyɛnhyɛn bi nkutoo na na aka gu hɔ a ɛredɛw anadwo no
Holy Office Established	Wɔde Tumidi Kronkron no Si Hɔ
As already noted many native and foreign born Mexicans were punished and some were killed for criticizing or for not accepting the new religion
Sɛnea yɛaka dedaw no wɔtwee Mexico ɔmamma ne amamfrafo a wɔwoo wɔn wɔ hɔ pii aso na wokunkum wɔn mu bi esiane sɛ wɔkasa tiaa ɔsom foforo no anaa wɔannye antom nti
This brought about an inquisition created by the friars and later by the bishops
Na eyi na ɛde atirimɔden asenni a nkokorafo de bae a asɔfopɔn no foaa so akyiri yi no bae
However the first General Inquisitor in Mexico Don Pedro Moya de Contreras came from Spain in to set up officially the Tribunal of the Holy Office of Inquisition there
Nanso Ɔtirimɔdenfo Panyin a odi kan wɔ Mexico Don Pedro Moya de Contreras fi Spain baa hɔ de Tumidi Kronkron no Atirimɔden Asenni Bagua no besii hɔ wɔ mmara kwan so
This court quit functioning in
Saa asenni bagua yi gyaee adwuma yɛ wɔ mu
Thus from there were some three hundred years of harassment torture and death for those who did not share the Catholic beliefs
Enti efi reba no wɔde bɛyɛ mfe ahaasa dii wɔn a wɔannye Katolek gyidi ahorow antom no ani yɛɛ wɔn ayayade na wokunkum wɔn
When someone was accused he was tortured until he confessed
Sɛ wɔbɔ obi sobo a na wɔyɛ no ayayade araa kosi sɛ ɔbɛka ne bɔne
The court expected him to renounce his anti Catholic practices and accept the beliefs of the church
Na asenni bagua no hwehwɛ sɛ ɔpow ne nneyɛe a etia Katoleksom no na ogye asɔre no gyidi ahorow tom
The accused was freed only if he proved his innocence if his guilt could not be proved or lastly if he confessed and repented
Sɛ wobegyae nea wɔabɔ no sobo no a gye sɛ ɔkyerɛ sɛ ne ho nni asɛm anaasɛ wɔantumi ankyerɛ sɛ odi fɔ anaa nea etwa to no ɔka ne bɔne na ɔsakra
In the latter case his statement that he detested his offense and promised to make amends for what he had done was publicly read
Wɔ nea etwa to no mu no na wɔkenkan asɛm a ɔka de tia ne bɔne no na ɔhyɛ bɔ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nsakrae wɔ nea wayɛ no ho wɔ baguam
In any event he lost his property and had to pay a heavy fine
Ne nyinaa akyi no na ɔhwere n’agyapade na na wɔbɔ no ka kɛse
Found guilty he was turned over to the secular authorities to be punished
Sɛ odi fɔ a na wɔde no ma amammui atumfoɔ no ma wɔtwe n’aso
This generally ended with his being burned at the stake either while still alive or after having been put to death moments before
Nea na eyi taa kowie ne sɛ wɔhyew no wɔ dua ho anikan so anaa bere a wɔakum no akyi bere tiaa bi
For public execution of sentences a huge auto da fe was held
Sɛ wɔrekum nnipa a wɔabu wɔn fɔ wɔ baguam a na wɔbɔ gua kɛse
A public proclamation would be made throughout the city to inform everyone of the day and the place to convene
Wɔbɔ amanneɛ wɔ baguam ka ɛda ne beae a wobehyiam kyerɛ obiara wɔ kurow no nyinaa mu
That day the condemned ones would come out of the jails of the Tribunal of the Holy Office dressed in a sambenito a kind of cloak without sleeves carrying a candle between their hands a rope around their neck and a coroza cone shaped hat on their head
Saa da no wɔn a wɔabu wɔn fɔ no fi Tumidi Kronkron no Asenni Bagua no afiase ahorow mu ba a wɔhyehyɛ sambenito nguguso bi a enni nsa a kyɛnere hyehyɛ wɔn nsa ntam ahama kyekyere wɔn kɔn na coroza ɛkyɛw a emu abukaw bi hyehyɛ wɔn ti
After the crimes against the Catholic faith were read the punishment decided upon for each victim would be meted out
Bere a wɔakenkan bɔne a wɔayɛ atia Katoleksom awie no wɔde asotwe a wɔkyerɛ sɛ wɔmfa mma wɔn mu biara no ma no
In this way many were condemned and punished in the name of religion
Saa kwan yi so na wobuu nnipa pii fɔ twee wɔn aso wɔ nyamesom din mu
The cruelty and the intolerance of the clergy were evident to the crowds who observed the victims dying at the stake
Nnipadɔm a wɔkɔhwɛɛ sɛnea wɔn a wobuu wɔn fɔ no wuwui wɔ dua ho no huu asɔfo no atirimɔdensɛm ne nneɛma ho koma a na wonni no
Ɛne Kristosom Nhyia Koraa
Outright Opposition to Christianity	Kristo Yesu de hyɛɛ n’asuafo no nsa sɛ wɔnsakra nkurɔfo mmra nokware Kristosom mu
Christ Jesus commissioned his disciples to convert people to true Christianity
Ɔhyɛe sɛ Enti monkɔ nkɔyɛ amanaman nyinaa m’asuafo
He commanded Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you
Matthew
Mommɔ wɔn asu nhyɛ Agya ne Ɔba ne honhom kronkron din mu na monkyerɛkyerɛ wɔn sɛ wonni nea mahyɛ mo nyinaa so
Mateo
However Jesus never indicated that people should be converted by force
Nanso Yesu ankyerɛ da sɛ wɔnhyɛ nkurɔfo mma wɔnsakra
Rather Jesus said Wherever anyone does not take you in or listen to your words on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off your feet
Mmom no Yesu kae sɛ Obiara a ɔrennye mo na ɔrentie mo asɛm no mufi ofi anaa kurow no mu rekɔ a momporoporow mo nan ase tutuw
The final judgment of these people is left to Almighty God Jehovah without physical intervention by Christians
Atemmu a awiei koraa no ɛbɛba saa nkurɔfo yi so no hyɛ Ade Nyinaa so Tumfoɔ Nyankopɔn Yehowa nsa a Kristofo nnya mu kyɛfa koraa
Clearly then wherever an Inquisition was carried out in the world it was done in outright opposition to Christian principles
Enti ɛda adi pefee sɛ wiase baabiara a Atirimɔden Asenni kɔɔ so wɔ hɔ no na ɛne Kristofo nnyinasosɛm ahorow nhyia koraa
The climate of religious tolerance that now prevails in Mexico allows people to exercise freedom as to the way they worship God
Nyamesom hokwan a mprempren ɛwɔ Mexico no ma nkurɔfo nya ahofadi wɔ ɔkwan a wɔfa so som Onyankopɔn no mu
But the centuries of the so called Holy Inquisition remain as an evil page in the history of the Mexican Catholic Church

My Father Was Atom Bombed Out Of Prison 	Wɔde Atom Ɔtopae Yii Me Papa Fii Afiase ’
At a
m
on August an atom bomb exploded over Hiroshima Japan devastating the city and wiping out tens of thousands of its population
Atom ɔtopae bi towee wɔ Hiroshima Japan wɔ August anɔpa na ɛsɛee kurow no pasaa kunkum emufo mpempem pii
My father had refused to worship the emperor and support Japan s militarism so he was at that time an inmate in the Hiroshima prison
Na me papa apow sɛ ɔbɛsom ɔhempɔn no aboa Japan sraadisɛm enti saa bere no na ɔda Hiroshima afiase hɔ
FATHER often described what occurred that memorable morning
NA PAPA taa ka nea esii saa anɔpa a werɛ remfi da no ho asɛm
The light flashed on the ceiling of my cell he said
Ɔkaee sɛ Hann no hyerɛnee wɔ m’afiasedan nsɛmso no so
Then I heard a terribly loud roar as if all the mountains had collapsed at one time
Afei metee nnyigyei denneennen bi te sɛ nea mmepɔw nyinaa adwiriw agu bere koro mu
Instantly the cell was shrouded with a thick darkness
Mpofirim afiasedan no mu duruu sum kabii
I shoved my head under my mattress to escape what appeared to be a dark gas
Mede me ti hyɛɛ me pikyi no ase na makwati biribi a ɛte sɛ mframa bɔne tuntum bi no
After seven or eight minutes I lifted my head from under the mattress and found that the gas had dissipated
Simma ason anaa awotwe akyi no miyii me ti fii pikyi no ase na mihui sɛ mframa bɔne ’ no kɔ
It was light once again
Na ɛhɔnom ayɛ hann bio
Articles from the shelf and a large quantity of dust had fallen making a real mess
Na nneɛma a ɛhyehyɛ ade mu wɔ soro ahwehwe fam na dɔte pii gugu fam hɔ na ɛhɔ ayɛ basaa ankasa
Because of the high wall encircling the prison no fire had come in from the outside
Esiane sɛ na afasu atenten atwa afiase no ho ahyia nti ogya biara annɛw amma hɔ
I looked through the back window and was thunderstruck !	 Mehwɛɛ mfɛnsere a ɛwɔ ɔdan no akyi no mu na me ho dwiriw me !
The jail workshops and the wooden buildings had all been crushed flat
Na afiase no adwinnan ne nnua adan no nyinaa adwiriw agu fam
Then I looked through the small front window
Afei mehwɛɛ mfɛnsere ketewaa a ɛwɔ ɔdan no anim no mu
The cells of the opposite block had been torn to pieces
Na afiasedan a ɛne me de di nhwɛanim no abubu pasaa
Prisoners who survived were crying for help
Na nneduafo a wɔanwuwu no reteɛteɛm de hwehwɛ mmoa
There was fear and panic a scene of dire confusion and terror
Na ehu ne akomatu da adi wɔ hɔ nkurɔfo a wɔayɛ basaa kɛse na ehu aka wɔn
As a boy I thrilled to listen to Father tell about as he put it being atom bombed out of prison
Sɛ abarimaa no na m’ani gye sɛ metie sɛ Papa ka sɛ wɔde atom ɔtopae yii me fii afiase sɛnea na ɔka ho asɛm no
He related the story without feelings of guilt because he had been imprisoned unjustly
Na ɔmfa afobu nkate biara nka asɛm no efisɛ na wɔde no ato afiase wɔ ɔkwan a ɛnteɛ so
Before telling about the charges against Father and how he was treated during his years of confinement let me explain how my parents became associated with the Todaisha as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in Japan was then called
Ansa na mɛka sobo a wɔde bɔɔ Papa ne nea wɔde yɛɛ no wɔ n’afiasenna no mu ho asɛm no ma menkyerɛkyerɛ nea ɛyɛe a m’awofo ne Todaisha sɛnea na wɔfrɛ Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society wɔ Japan saa bere no bɔɔ fekuw
Searching for a Purpose	Atirimpɔw a Ɔhwehwɛe
Father was an ardent lover of books and early in life he sought to improve himself
Na Papa ani gye nhoma ho yiye na wɔ ne mmofrabere mu no n’ankasa bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ obesua ade na ama asi no yiye wɔ asetram
When he was still in the fifth grade of elementary school he sneaked out of his home in Ishinomori in northeastern Japan
Bere a odii mfe anum wɔ mfitiase sukuu mu no oguan fii fie wɔ Ishinomori wɔ Japan kusuu fam apuei
With only enough money for a one way ticket he boarded a train for Tokyo where he was determined to become a houseboy for Shigenobu Okuma who had twice been prime minister of Japan
Ɔfaa keteke sɛ ɔrekɔ Tokyo a na sika a ɔwɔ no betumi de no adu hɔ nkutoo na na wasi ne bo sɛ ɔbɛyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ ama Shigenobu Okuma a na wayɛ Japan man soafo panyin mprenu sɛ abarimaa a osiesie ne fie
But when this shabbily dressed country boy appeared at Mr
Okuma s home his request for employment was turned down
Nanso bere a akuraa ase abarimaa a wayɛ ne ho basaa no duu Owura Okuma fie no wamfa no sɛ ne dwumayeni
Later Father obtained live in employment in a milk shop
Akyiri yi Papa nyaa adwuma wɔ baabi a wɔtɔn nufusu a ɛhɔ ara na na ɔte
While still a teenager my father began to attend lectures by politicians and scholars
Bere a na me papa da so ara yɛ abarimaa no ofii ase kotiee amammuifo ne nhomanimfo ɔkasa ahorow
In one lecture the Bible was mentioned as a very important book
Wɔkaa Bible no ho asɛm wɔ ɔkasa biako mu sɛ ɛyɛ nhoma a ɛho hia yiye
So Father obtained a Bible complete with cross references and a Bible atlas
Enti Papa tɔɔ Bible a kyerɛw nsɛm a ɛtwe adwene si kyerɛw nsɛm afoforo so ne Bible mu asase mfonini wom
He was deeply impressed by what he read and was moved to want to do work that would benefit all mankind
N’ani gyee nea ɔkenkanee no ho yiye na ɛma onyaa ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ adwuma a adesamma nyinaa benya so mfaso
Eventually Father returned home and in April when he was he married year old Hagino
Awiei koraa no Papa san kɔɔ fie na bere a odii mfe no ɔwaree Higino a na wadi mfe no wɔ April mu
Shortly after Father married a relative sent him literature published by the Todaisha
Papa waree akyi pɛɛ no ne busuani bi de nhoma a Todaisha tintimii manaa no
Impressed with what he read Father wrote to the Todaisha in Tokyo
Esiane sɛ Papa ani gyee nea ɔkenkanee no ho nti ɔkyerɛw Todaisha wɔ Tokyo
In June a full time minister from Sendai by the name of Matsue Ishii visited him in Ishinomori
Wɔ June mu no bere nyinaa somfo bi a wɔfrɛ no Matsue Ishii a ofi Sendai bɛsraa no wɔ Ishinomori
Father accepted a set of books from her that included The Harp of God Creation and Government
Papa gyee nhoma ahorow bi a The Harp of God Creation ne Government ka ho fii ne nkyɛn
Finding a Purpose in Life	Atirimpɔw a Onyae wɔ Asetra Mu
Almost at once Father perceived that various church teachings such as man having an immortal soul the wicked burning forever in hellfire and the Creator being a triune God were false
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ Papa huu ntɛm ara sɛ asɔre nkyerɛkyerɛ ahorow te sɛ onipa a ɔwɔ ɔkra a enwu da nnebɔneyɛfo a wɔyɛ wɔn ayayade daa wɔ hell gya mu ne Ɔbɔadeɛ no a ɔyɛ baasakoro Nyankopɔn no yɛ atoro
He also realized that this world would end
Ohui nso sɛ wiase yi bɛba n’awiei
Wanting to know what he should do he contacted the appointed representative of the Todaisha who visited him in August and as a result of their discussions Father was baptized and decided to become a full time minister of Jehovah
Esiane sɛ na ɔpɛ sɛ ohu nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nti okohuu Todaisha nanmusini a na wɔapaw no a ɔbɛsraa no wɔ August mu no na nea efii wɔn nkɔmmɔbɔ no mu bae ne sɛ wɔbɔɔ Papa asu na osii gyinae sɛ ɔbɛyɛ Yehowa bere nyinaa somfo
After extended discussions Mother too became convinced that what she had learned from the Bible was the truth
Bere a wɔne Maame bɔɔ nkɔmmɔ pii akyi no ɔno nso begye dii sɛ nea na wasua afi Bible mu no ne nokware no
She dedicated her life to Jehovah and was baptized in October
Ohyiraa ne nkwa so maa Yehowa na wɔbɔɔ no asu October
When my father put his property up for auction his relatives thought that he had lost his mind
Bere a Papa tɔn n’asase nyinaa no n’abusuafo susuwii sɛ ne tirim ka no
Life as Full Time Ministers	Asetra sɛ Bere Nyinaa Asomfo
Father left all the money received from the auction to his mother and he and Mother went to Tokyo in November
Papa de sika a onya fii nneɛma a ɔtɔnee no mu nyinaa maa ne maame na ɔne Maame kɔɔ Tokyo November
Although they had received no instructions on how to talk to others about the good news of the Kingdom they started preaching the day after they arrived there
Matthew
Ɛwom sɛ na wɔn nsa nkaa akwankyerɛ biara a ɛfa sɛnea wɔbɛka Ahenni asɛmpa no akyerɛ afoforo ho de nanso woduu hɔ a ade kyee no wofii asɛnka ase
Mateo
Their life was not easy
Na asetra yɛ den ma wɔn
Especially was it hard on my mother who was then only years old
Na ɛyɛ den ma me maame a na wadi mfe pɛ no titiriw
There were no fellow Witnesses no meetings and no congregation just a daily schedule of distributing Bible literature from house to house from a
m
to p

Na Adansefo afoforo nhyiam horow ne asafo biara nni hɔ nea wɔyɛɛ ara ne sɛ wɔkyekyɛɛ Bible ho nhoma da biara wɔ afie afie fi anɔpa kosi anwummere
In their preaching assignment was changed from Tokyo to Kobe
Wɔ mu no woyii wɔn fii Tokyo sɛ wɔnkɔka asɛm no wɔ Kobe
I was born there on February
Wɔwoo me wɔ hɔ wɔ February mu
My mother worked zealously in the ministry until a month before my birth
Me maame de nnam yɛɛ ɔsom adwuma no kosii bere a na aka ɔsram biako ma wawo me no
Afterward my parents moved to Yamaguchi to Ube to Kure and finally to Hiroshima preaching in each place for about a year
Ɛno akyi no m’awofo tu kɔɔ Yamaguchi Ube Kure ne awiei koraa no Hiroshima na wɔde bɛyɛ afe kaa asɛm wɔ kurow no biara mu
My Parents Are Arrested	Wɔkyeree M’awofo
As Japanese militarism increased publications of the Watch Tower Society were banned and the Witnesses were put under strict surveillance by the Special Secret Service Police
Bere a Japanfo sraadisɛm nyaa nkɔso no wɔbaraa Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no nhoma ahorow na Kokoam Polisifo Soronko no tetɛw Adansefo no bere nyinaa
Then on June full time ministers of Jehovah s Witnesses were rounded up throughout Japan
Afei wɔkyeree Yehowa Adansefo bere nyinaa asomfo wɔ Japan nyinaa June
Father and Mother were among those arrested
Na Papa ne Maame ka wɔn a wɔkyeree wɔn no ho
I was turned over to the care of my grandmother who lived in Ishinomori
Wɔde me hyɛɛ me nanabea a na ɔte Ishinomori no nsa sɛ ɔnhwɛ me
After being detained for eight months Mother was released and put on probation and eventually in I was able to join her in Sendai
Bere a wɔde Maame too afiase asram awotwe akyi no woyii no ma aban hwɛɛ ne nneyɛe yiye na awiei koraa wɔ mu no mitumi kɔkaa ne ho wɔ Sendai
In the meantime Father along with other Witnesses was interrogated by the secret police at the Hiroshima police station
Saa bere no kokoam polisifo no bisabisaa Papa ne Adansefo afoforo nsɛm wɔ Hiroshima polisifo adwumam
Because they refused to worship the emperor or support Japan s militarism the Witnesses were severely beaten
Esiane sɛ Adansefo no ansom ɔhempɔn no anaa wɔammoa Japan sraadisɛm nti wɔboroo wɔn pasaa
The interrogator could not budge Father from worshiping Jehovah
Nea obisabisaa wɔn nsɛm no antumi amma Papa annyae Yehowa som
After more than two years in detention Father was put on trial
Bere a wɔmaa Papa daa afiase bɛboro mfe abien akyi no wodii n’asɛm
During one session the judge asked Miura what do you think of His Majesty the Emperor ? 	Wɔ asenni no fa bi mu no ɔtemmufo no bisae sɛ Miura wubu Ɔhempɔn Tumfoɔ no dɛn ? 
 His Majesty the Emperor is also a descendant of Adam and is a mortal imperfect human Father answered
Papa buae sɛ Ɔhempɔn Tumfoɔ no nso yɛ Adam aseni na ɔyɛ onipa a obetumi awu ɔnyɛ pɛ
That statement so astonished the court stenographer that he failed to record it
Saa asɛm no maa asennibea no nsɛm kyerɛwfo ho dwiriw no araa ma wankyerɛw anto hɔ
You see most Japanese at that time believed the emperor to be a god
Saa bere no na Japanfo dodow no ara gye di sɛ ɔhempɔn no yɛ onyame
Father received a sentence of five years in prison and the judge told him that unless he gave up his faith he would be in prison the rest of his life
Wɔhyɛe sɛ wɔmfa Papa nto afiase mfe anum na ɔtemmufo no ka kyerɛɛ no sɛ sɛ wampa ne gyidi a ɔbɛda afiase ne nkwa nna a aka nyinaa
Soon afterward in December Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor Hawaii
Ɛno akyi pɛɛ December no Japan tow hyɛɛ United States so wɔ Pearl Harbor Hawaii
Food in prison became scarce and during the winter months Father had many cold sleepless nights because of lack of clothing
Aduan ho bɛyɛɛ na wɔ afiase hɔ na wɔ awɔw bere asram no mu no awɔw dee Papa na wantumi anna anadwo mpɛn pii efisɛ na onni nkataho
Although cut off from all spiritual association he had access to the Bible in the prison library and by reading it over and over again he maintained spiritual strength
Ɛwom sɛ na ɔne obiara nnya honhom mu fekubɔ de nanso na onya Bible wɔ afiase hɔ nhomakorabea na bere a ɔkenkanee mpɛn pii no onyaa honhom fam ahoɔden
When the Bomb Fell	Bere a Ɔtopae no Paee No
Early on the morning of August a prisoner wanted to exchange books with Father
Na ɔdeduani bi pɛ sɛ ɔde ne nhoma sesa Papa de wɔ August anɔpahema
This was forbidden but since the prisoner had already slid his book across the hallway into Father s cell he slid his book into the other prisoner s cell
Na wɔmma eyi ho kwan nanso esiane sɛ na ɔdeduani no apia ne nhoma no afa abrannaa no so ma aba Papa afiasedan no mu dedaw nti opiaa ne nhoma no kɔhyɛɛ ɔdeduani biako no afiasedan mu
So rather than follow his usually inflexible schedule that morning Father was reading when the bomb fell
Enti sɛ anka Papa bedi ne nhyehyɛe katee no akyi saa anɔpa no na ɔrekenkan nhoma na ɔtopae no paee
Ordinarily he would have been using the toilet in his cell at that time of the morning
Na anka ɛbɛyɛ nea ɔwɔ n’afiasedan no mu tiafi so anɔpa saa bere no
After the blast Father saw that the toilet area had been destroyed by falling debris
Bere a ɛpaee akyi no Papa hui sɛ dɔte a edwiriw gui asɛe baabi a tiafi no wɔ no
Father was then taken to the nearby Iwakuni prison
Afei wɔde Papa kɔɔ Iwakuni afiase a ɛbɛn hɔ no mu
Soon after that Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces and he was released from prison amid the postwar chaos
Ɛno akyi pɛɛ no Japan de wɔn ho kɔhyɛɛ Asraafo a Wɔayɛ Nkabom no nsa na woyii no fii afiase bere a nneɛma yɛɛ baasa wɔ ɔko no akyi no
He returned home to Ishinomori in December
Ɔsan baa fie wɔ Ishinomori December mu
His health had been ruined
Na n’akwahosan asɛe
He was only but he looked like an old man
Na wadi mfe pɛ nanso na ɔte sɛ akwakoraa
At first I could not believe he was my father
Mfiase no mannye anni sɛ ɛyɛ me papa
His Faith Still Strong	Ne Gyidi Da so Ara Yɛ Den
Japan was in a chaotic condition and we did not know where the handful of faithful Witnesses had been scattered to
Na Japan ayɛ basaa na na yennim faako a Adansefo anokwafo kakraa bi a wɔaka no ahwete kɔ
Nor did we have available any of the literature of Jehovah s Witnesses
Saa ara nso na na yenni Yehowa Adansefo nhoma biara
Yet Father taught me directly from the Bible the truth about Jehovah s Kingdom the new world and the approaching battle of Armageddon
Psalm Isaiah Daniel Matthew
Nanso Papa kyerɛɛ me nokware a ɛfa Yehowa Ahenni wiase foforo no ne Harmagedon ko a ɛreba no ho ade fii Bible no mu tee
Dwom Yesaia Daniel Mateo
Later when I was taught the evolution theory in high school and began to doubt the existence of God my father tried to convince me of God s existence
Akyiri yi bere a wɔde adannandi nkyerɛkyerɛ no kyerɛkyerɛɛ me wɔ ntoaso sukuu na m’adwenem fii ase yɛɛ me naa wɔ wɔ a Onyankopɔn wɔ hɔ ho no me papa bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛma magye adi sɛ Onyankopɔn wɔ hɔ
When I was hesitant to believe he finally said Most of the people of the world supported the war and became guilty of shedding blood
Bere a na mempɛ sɛ migye di no awiei koraa no ɔkae sɛ Wiase no mu nnipa dodow no ara gyinaa ɔko no akyi na wodii mogya ho fɔ
I for my part stuck to Bible truth and never supported either militarism emperor worship or the war
Me de mikuraa Bible mu nokware mu na mammoa sraadisɛm ɔhempɔn som anaa ɔko no
So consider carefully for yourself which is the true way of life you should walk in
Enti w’ankasa susuw asetra kwan a ɛyɛ nokware a ɛsɛ sɛ wofa so no ho yiye
Knowing what my father taught and lived by and comparing that with what I was learning in school I could see that the evolution theory could not be a sound way of thinking
Bere a minim nea me papa kyerɛkyerɛe na ɔde bɔɔ ne bra na mede totoo nea na meresua wɔ sukuu ho no mitumi hui sɛ adannandi nkyerɛkyerɛ no ntumi nyɛ nsusuwii pa
Although no evolutionist had risked his life for his beliefs my father was willing to die for his
Ɛwom sɛ na adannandini biara mfaa ne nkwa ntoo asiane mu wɔ ne gyidi ho de nanso na me papa wɔ ɔpɛ sɛ obewu ama ne gyidi
One day in March more than five years after the war had ended Father was reading the Asahi newspaper
Da bi wɔ March mu bɛboro mfe anum wɔ ɔko no akyi no na Papa rekenkan Asahi atesɛm krataa no
Suddenly he cried out Hey they came they came ! 	Ɔteɛɛm mpofirim sɛ Yiee wɔaba wɔaba ! 
He showed the paper to me
Ɔde atesɛm krataa no kyerɛɛ me
It was an article about five missionaries of Jehovah s Witnesses who had just arrived in Osaka
Na ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛfa Yehowa Adansefo asɛmpatrɛwfo baanum a wobeduu Osaka nkyɛe ho
Leaping with joy Father contacted the newspaper and learned that Jehovah s Witnesses had established a branch office in Tokyo
Papa de anigye huruwii na ɔne atesɛm krataa no adwumam dii nkitaho na ɔtee sɛ Yehowa Adansefo ahyehyɛ baa dwumadibea wɔ Tokyo
He obtained the address and visited the branch thus restoring contact with Jehovah s organization

In our family moved to Sendai
Wɔ mu no yɛn abusua no tu kɔtraa Sendai
Watch Tower Society missionaries Donald and Mabel Haslett moved there that same year and rented a house to hold the Watchtower Study
Ɔwɛn Aban Asafo no asɛmpatrɛwfo Donald ne Mabel Haslett tu baa hɔ saa afe no ara begyee ɔdan bi a yɛbɛyɛ Ɔwɛn Aban Adesua wom atua ho ka
Only four attended that first meeting the Hasletts my father and I

Later Shinichi and Masako Tohara Adeline Nako and Lillian Samson joined the Hasletts as missionaries in Sendai
Akyiri yi Shinichi ne Masako Tohara Adeline Nako ne Lillian Samson bɛkaa Haslett ne ne yere ho wɔ Sendai sɛ asɛmpatrɛwfo

Mother whose faith had been shaken by things that had occurred during the war soon joined us in going to meetings and sharing in the field ministry

I was moved to dedicate my life to serve Jehovah God and was baptized on April
Ɛkaa me na mihyiraa me nkwa so sɛ mɛsom Yehowa Nyankopɔn na wɔbɔɔ me asu April
Following the war Father worked as a salesman for an insurance company
Wɔ ɔko no akyi no Papa yɛɛ adwuma sɛ ɔdetɔnfo maa insurance adwuma bi
Despite the aftereffects of his imprisonment which included a kidney disorder and high blood pressure he had a strong desire to resume the full time ministry as a pioneer
Nea efii n’afiasenna mu bae a asaabo mu yare ne mogya mmoroso ka ho nyinaa akyi no na ɔwɔ ɔpɛ a emu yɛ den sɛ ɔbɛsan afi bere nyinaa som adwuma no ase sɛ ɔkwampaefo
He did so about the same time that I was baptized
Ɔyɛɛ saa bɛyɛ bere a wɔbɔɔ me asu no ara
Even though poor health prevented him from continuing as a pioneer very long his zeal for the ministry moved me to quit the university that I was attending and to take up the full time ministry as a career

On May we commenced our ministry as special pioneers in Beppu on Kyushu Island

There were only a handful of Witnesses on the whole island then

Now over years later we have spiritually thriving circuits with over Witnesses on the island

In the spring of Isamu and I received invitations to attend the Watch Tower Bible School of Gilead in the United States
Wɔ fefɛw bere mu no wɔtoo nsa frɛɛ me ne Isamu sɛ yɛnkɔ Ɔwɛn Aban Gilead Bible Sukuu no wɔ United States
We were overjoyed

However when I received a physical checkup in preparation for the trip doctors found that I had tuberculosis
Nanso bere a mekɔyɛɛ apɔwmuden ho nhwehwɛmu de siesiee me ho maa akwantu no nnuruyɛfo hui sɛ mebɔ nsamanwaw
Greatly disappointed I returned home to Sendai

By then Father s physical health had worsened and he was resting at home in bed
Saa bere no na Papa yare no mu ayɛ den na na ɔda mpa mu regye n’ahome wɔ fie
Our rented house was made up of only one square foot tatami room

My father and I lay side by side

Since Father could not work Mother had a rough time caring for our financial needs

In January Frederick W
Franz then the vice president of the Watch Tower Society visited Japan and a special convention was arranged to be held in Kyoto

Father urged my mother to attend

Although reluctant to leave us in our sick condition she obeyed Father and left for the convention
Ɛwom sɛ na ɔmpɛ sɛ ogyaw yɛn hɔ bere a yɛyare no de nanso otiee Papa na ɔkɔɔ nhyiam kɛse no
Soon afterward Father s condition began to worsen day by day
Ɛno akyi pɛɛ no Papa tebea no mu fii ase yɛɛ den da biara
As we lay side by side I started to worry and I asked him how we were going to support ourselves
Bere a na meda ne nkyɛn no mifii ase dwennwenee na mibisaa no nea yɛbɛyɛ ahwɛ yɛn ho
To that he answered We ve served Jehovah God even risking our lives and he is the almighty God
Obuae sɛ Yɛasom Yehowa Nyankopɔn yɛde yɛn nkwa too asiane mu mpo na ɔne ade nyinaa so tumfoɔ Nyankopɔn no
Why do you worry ?	Dɛn nti na wudwennwen ?
Jehovah will without fail provide what we need
Nea ɛbɛyɛ biara Yehowa de nea yehia bɛma yɛn
He then admonished me in a most tender way saying Cultivate in yourself a stronger faith
Afei ɔde odwo kɛse tuu me fo sɛ Nya gyidi a emu yɛ den
On March Father quietly took his last breath
Papa wuu dinn wɔ March mu
After his funeral I visited the insurance company for which he worked to settle things with them
Bere a yɛyɛɛ n’ayi wiei no mekɔɔ insurance adwumakuw a ɔne wɔn yɛɛ adwuma no mu sɛ me ne wɔn rekodi nsɛm bi ho dwuma
As I was leaving the branch manager handed me a paper bag and said This is your father s

Upon returning home I discovered quite a large sum of money inside
Bere a mebaa fie no mihuu sika pii wom
When I asked the manager about it later he explained that the money was from a premium that had been deducted monthly from Father s salary without his knowledge
Bere a akyiri yi mibisaa adwuma no so panyin ɛho asɛm no ɔkyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ ɛyɛ sika bi a na wɔtew fi Papa akatua mu ɔsram biara a na onnim
Thus Father s words Jehovah will without fail provide what we need did come true
Enti Papa asɛm a ese Nea ɛbɛyɛ biara Yehowa de nea yehia bɛma yɛn no baam
This greatly strengthened my faith in Jehovah s protective care
Eyi hyɛɛ gyidi a mewɔ wɔ Yehowa ɔhwɛ a ahobammɔ wom mu no mu den yiye

The material assistance provided by that money helped me to concentrate on recuperating at home

A year later in Mother and I were appointed as special pioneers

Afterward I served as a traveling overseer in Japan and then in I had the privilege of attending the ten month course of the Gilead School at the world headquarters of Jehovah s Witnesses in Brooklyn New York

When I returned to Japan I again took up serving congregations as a traveling overseer

Then in I married Yasuko Haba who was working at the branch office of Jehovah s Witnesses in Tokyo
Afei mewaree Yasuko Haba a na ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ Yehowa Adansefo baa dwumadibea a ɛwɔ Tokyo no wɔ mu

And this one peak is just a small part of the magnificent Himalayas

Unique Life Zones	Ɛso Tebea Da Nsow
Most mountains have various life zones or environments largely because the temperature drops about
degrees Fahrenheit
C for each feet m of altitude
Mmepɔw dodow no ara so tebea gu ahorow na nea enti a ɛte saa titiriw ne sɛ wim hyew ano brɛ ase bɛyɛ

Variations in rain soil and wind also make each zone unique

An example of the variety of such environments are the San Francisco Peaks in Arizona U

They are the highest mountains in that state
Ɛno ne ɔmantam no mu mmepɔw a ɛware sen biara
If you start from the base of the mountains at the Coconino Plateau and climb up to the summit of one of the San Francisco Peaks you will first observe an ecological community that includes lizards and cacti in desert conditions

Progressively you will enter cooler life zones home to mountain goats and spruce trees
Nkakrankakra wubedu baabi a ɛhɔ tebea no yɛ wiridudu a eye ma atorɔm ne nnua a wɔfrɛ no spruce
Finally you will reach the arctic alpine conditions of the summit
Awiei koraa no wubedu bepɔw no atifi a awɔw a ano yɛ den yiye wɔ hɔ
On just this one climb you could encounter the same variety of life forms and environments that would otherwise be found only if you were to travel inland near sea level from Mexico to Canada !	Wɔ saa bepɔw biako pɛ yi so no wubehu abɔde ne tebea a egu ahorow a sɛ wofa asase a ne sorokɔ ne po reyɛ ayɛ pɛ so fi Mexico kɔ Canada nkutoo a na wubehu !
Have you experienced the exhilarating sensation of breathing crisp fresh mountain air ?	So woahome bepɔw so mframa a emu yɛ nwini emu tew na ɛyɛ dɛ pɛn ?
The lower temperature of the air is one explanation for this sensation
Sɛnea mframa no mu dwo ne ade biako nti a ɛyɛ dɛ no
But where there are no cities nearby mountain air can also be clearer and cleaner
Nanso bepɔw so mframa mu tumi tew yiye wɔ baabi a nkurow biara mmɛn hɔ no
In every cubic centimeter of air at feet m there may be just tiny particles of dust pollen and so forth
Ebia dɔte nhwiren aba ne nea ɛkeka ho mu nneɛma nketenkete bɛyɛ pɛ na ɛwɔ mframa dodow a ɛwɔ soro mita biara mu
Compare that to the air in large cities where as many as of these particles can be in the same amount of air space !	Fa ɛno toto mframa a ɛwɔ nkurow akɛse mu a saa nneɛma nketenkete yi bɛyɛ betumi atra mframa a ne dodow te saa ara mu ho !
This explains why modern observatories are often built on mountains where clear dry air provides ideal conditions for astronomical observation

Of course mountains are not so hospitable at higher elevations where atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels drop solar radiation increases and gale force winds cause temperatures to plummet

You will likewise note that many other political boundaries are drawn along massive mountain chains

These immovable barriers have restricted travel and trade between peoples of differing languages and customs
Saa mpampa a wontumi nyi mfi hɔ yi ato nnipa a ɛsono wɔn kasa ne amammerɛ akwantu ne aguadi ano hye
Hence the presence of mountains likely has had a modifying influence on the shape and size of the country where you live the language you speak and the customs of your land

High mountains also break up the flow of the wind

This can have an impact on the cycles of rain snow wind and temperature

The Weaker Vessel An Insult to Women ?	 Anwenne a Ɛyɛ Mmerɛw So Wɔka de Bu Mmea Animtiaa ?

DOES the Bible expression weaker vessel degrade women ?	SO BIBLE mu asɛm a ɛne anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no bu mmea animtiaa ?
The Bible verse in question is Peter which states You husbands continue dwelling in like manner with them according to knowledge assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel the feminine one since you are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life in order for your prayers not to be hindered
Bible nkyekyem a yɛreka ho asɛm no ne Petro NW a ɛka sɛ Okununom mo ne wɔn ntra nimdeɛ mu saa ara na munni wɔn ni sɛ anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɔbea efisɛ mo nso mo ne wɔn yɛ nkwa dom no difo bi na mo mpaebɔ kwan ansiw
When Peter wrote these words to fellow Christians women had very few rights not only in the ancient pagan world but also among the apostate Jewish community
Bere a Petro kyerɛw nsɛm yi kɔmaa ne mfɛfo Kristofo no hokwan kakraa bi na na mmea wɔ wɔ tete abosonsomfo aman no mu ne afei nso Yudafo awaefo mu
Were Peter and the early Christians advocating the then prevalent view of women ?	So na Petro ne tete Kristofo no rekamfo adwene a na wokura wɔ mmea ho saa bere no akyerɛ ?
Lesser Vessels ?	So Wɔyɛ Anwenne a Ɛba Fam ?
How would first century readers of Peter s words construe the term weaker vessel ?	Na afeha a edi kan no mu akenkanfo bɛte Petro asɛm a ɛne anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ase dɛn ?
The Greek word for vessel skeu os was used a number of times in the Greek Scriptures and refers to various containers implements utensils and instruments
Wɔde Hela asɛmfua ma anwenne skeu os dii dwuma mpɛn pii wɔ Hela Kyerɛwnsɛm no mu na ɛkyerɛ adekorade nnade anwinne ne nnwinnade ahorow
In calling women the weaker vessel Peter was not degrading women for the expression implied that the husband too was a fragile or weak vessel
Bere a Petro frɛɛ mmea sɛ anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no na ommu mmea animtiaa efisɛ na asɛm no kyerɛ sɛ okunu nso yɛ anwenne a ɛnyɛ den anaasɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw
Other Bible texts use similar imagery in referring to both women and men such as earthen vessels and vessels of mercy
Bible mu nsɛm afoforo de kasakoa a ɛtete saa ara ka mmea ne mmarima nyinaa ho asɛm te sɛ asase so anwenne ne mmɔborohunu anwenne
True Peter portrays women as the weaker of the sexes
Ɛwom Petro da no adi sɛ mmea yɛ mmerɛw sen mmarima
But Romans uses weak to apply to all humans male and female
Nanso Romafo ka sɛ nnipa nyinaa yɛ mmerɛw mmarima ne mmea
Therefore the early Christians would not have considered the term weaker vessel to be derogatory to women
Enti na tete Kristofo no remmu asɛm anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no sɛ ebu mmea animtiaa
If anything Peter s words would have been viewed as elevating the status of women
Mmom no na wobebu Petro nsɛm no sɛ ɛma mmea gyinabea yɛ kɛse koraa
In Peter s day respect for women hardly existed
Na wommu mmea wɔ Petro bere so
As God had long before foreseen husbands often dominated and abused their wives physically sexually and emotionally
Sɛnea Onyankopɔn hu siei bere tenten no okununom hyɛɛ wɔn yerenom so yɛɛ wɔn ayayade wɔ honam nna ne nkate mu mpɛn pii
Thus Peter s counsel to Christian husbands implied in effect Do not exploit the power worldly society has given men
Enti nea na afotu a Petro de maa okununom Kristofo kyerɛ ankasa ne sɛ Ɛnsɛ sɛ mode tumi a wiasefo de ama mmarima no di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so
Let us take a closer look at the term weaker
Ma yensusuw asɛmfua mmerɛw no ho yiye
Peter in this verse was referring not to emotional but to physical traits
Na ɛnyɛ nkate fam su horow ho asɛm na Petro reka wɔ nkyekyem yi mu na mmom honam fam de
Men are weak vessels in a comparative sense women are weaker vessels
Mmarima yɛ anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wɔde toto ho a mmea yɛ anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen wɔn
How so ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so ?
Bone and muscle structure are such that men are usually endowed with more physical strength
Sɛnea mmarima nnompe ne wɔn honam te no taa ma wonya honam fam ahoɔden kɛse
However there is no indication that Peter was making a comparison of moral spiritual or mental strength
Nanso biribiara nkyerɛ sɛ na Petro de wɔn abrabɔ honhom ne adwene mu ahoɔden retoto ho
Really as far as emotional reactions to events go women might best be described as different from men not necessarily weaker or stronger
Nokwarem no sɛ wɔka sɛnea wofi nkate mu yɛ ade wɔ nsɛm a esisi ho a wobetumi aka no yiye koraa sɛ mmea yɛ soronko wɔ mmarima ho na ɛnkyerɛ ankasa sɛ mmea yɛ mmerɛw anaa wɔwɔ ahoɔden kɛse
The Bible describes the strong moral character the endurance and the discernment of women who followed God s way such as Sarah Deborah Ruth and Esther to name but a few
Bible ka mmea a wɔyɛɛ nea Onyankopɔn pɛ no abrabɔ pa boasetɔ ne nhumu ho asɛm ebinom ne Sara Debora Rut ne Ester sɛ yɛbɛbobɔ wɔn mu kakraa bi din a
Humble men have no difficulty recognizing that women can be more intelligent than they are
Ɛnyɛ den mma mmarima ahobrɛasefo sɛ wobehu sɛ mmea betumi anya nyansa asen wɔn
Nonetheless some believe that a reference to women as weaker implies that they are lesser persons
Nanso ebinom gye di sɛ ka a wɔka sɛ mmea yɛ mmerɛw no kyerɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔba fam
But consider this example
Nanso susuw nhwɛso yi ho
A person has two useful containers
Obi wɔ adekorade abien a mfaso wɔ so
One is sturdy the other less so
Biako wɔ ahoɔden na nea ɛka ho no nni ahoɔden pii
Is the second vessel somehow less valued because it is not as sturdy ?	So obebu anwenne a ɛto so abien no sɛ ɛso nni mfaso pii wɔ ɔkwan bi so esiane sɛ enni ahoɔden kɛse nti ?
Actually the less sturdy one is usually treated with more care and honor than the sturdier one
Nokwarem no wɔtaa de ahwɛyiye ne nidi kɛse di nea enni ahoɔden pii no ho dwuma
Therefore is a woman of lesser value because she has less physical strength than a man ?	Enti so ɔbea ba fam esiane sɛ onni ahoɔden kɛse sɛ ɔbarima nti ?
Certainly not !	Dabida !
Peter uses the term weaker vessel not to denigrate women but to foster respect
Petro amfa asɛm anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ammu mmea animtiaa na mmom ɔde kanyan obu
In Like Manner
Saa Ara
According to Knowledge 	Nimdeɛ Mu 
Peter exhorted husbands to continue dwelling in like manner with them their wives according to knowledge
Petro tuu okununom fo sɛ wɔnkɔ so ne wɔn yerenom ntra nimdeɛ mu saa ara
’
 In like manner to whom ?	 Saa ara no fa henanom ho ?
In previous verses Peter was discussing Christ s loving care for his followers and he instructed husbands to care for their wives in like manner
Na Petro reka ɔdɔ mu a Kristo fi hwɛ n’akyidifo ho asɛm wɔ nkyekyem ahorow a edi eyi anim no mu na ɔhyɛɛ okununom sɛ wɔnhwɛ wɔn yerenom saa ara
Christ always placed his disciples welfare and interests ahead of his own personal desires and preferences
Na Kristo dwen n’asuafo yiyedi ne wɔn ahiade ho sen n’ankasa apɛde bere nyinaa
He was interested in their spiritual and physical welfare and he took their limitations into consideration
Na ɔkyerɛ wɔn honhom ne honam fam yiyedi ho anigye na odwen wɔn sintɔ ahorow ho
Husbands are to imitate Christ s loving example to behave toward their wives in like manner
Ɛsɛ sɛ okununom suasua Kristo nhwɛso a ɔdɔ wom no na wɔyɛ wɔn ade wɔ wɔn yerenom ho saa ara
A smooth running marriage does not happen by chance
Aware a ɛkɔ so yiye no nyɛ ade a ɛba kɛkɛ
Both husband and wife must know how to contribute to the success of the marriage
Ɛsɛ sɛ okunu ne ɔyere nyinaa hu sɛnea wɔbɛboa ma aware no ayɛ yiye
Hence Peter s advice is for husbands to continue dwelling with their wives according to knowledge
Enti Petro de afotu ma okununom sɛ wɔnkɔ so ne wɔn yerenom ntra nimdeɛ mu
Husbands need to study how Jehovah and his Son Jesus Christ dealt with women
Ɛho hia sɛ okununom sua sɛnea Yehowa ne ne Ba Yesu Kristo yɛ wɔn ade wɔ mmea ho no
They need to know how God wants them to treat their wives
Ɛho hia sɛ wohu sɛnea Onyankopɔn pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn yerenom
In addition husbands need to know their wives well their feelings strengths limitations likes and dislikes
Bio nso ɛho hia sɛ okununom hu wɔn yerenom yiye wɔn nkate horow wɔn ahoɔden wɔn sintɔ ahorow nea wɔpɛ ne nea wɔmpɛ
They need to know how to respect their wives intelligence experience and dignity
Ɛho hia sɛ wohu sɛnea wɔbɛkyerɛ obu wɔ wɔn yerenom nyansa osuahu ne nidi ho
The Bible says Husbands continue loving your wives just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it
Bible no ka sɛ Okununom monnɔ mo yerenom sɛnea Kristo nso dɔ asafo no na ɔde ne ho mae maa no
Saa ara nso na ɛsɛ okununom sɛ wɔdɔ wɔn ankasa wɔn yerenom sɛ wɔn ankasa nipadua
In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies
Nea ɔdɔ n’ankasa ne yere no dɔ ne ho
He who loves his wife loves himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but he feeds and cherishes it
Ephesians
Na obiara ntan n’ankasa honam na mmom ɔyɛn no na ɔhwɛ so yiye

Assign Them Honor	Munni Wɔn Ni
When Peter referred to women as the weaker vessel he also stated that husbands should be assigning them honor
Bere a Petro kaa mmea ho asɛm sɛ anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ɔkae nso sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ okununom di wɔn ni
’
In Greek the noun ti me conveys the sense of honor esteem value preciousness
Wɔ Hela mu no edin asɛm ti me kura adwene a ɛkyerɛ sɛ wodi biribi ni wobu no mfaso wɔ so na ɛsom bo
Paul instructed all Christians both men and women as follows In brotherly love have tender affection for one another
Ɔkwan foforo so no nidi a wɔde ma wɔn no nyɛ biribi a wɔde dom wɔn kɛkɛ na mmom nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ma wɔn a wogye tom
In showing honor to one another take the lead
Romans
Paulo hyɛɛ Kristofo mmarima ne mmea nyinaa sɛ wɔnyɛ nea edi so yi Momfa onuadɔ nnodɔ mo ho yiye munni kan nnidi mo ho ni
Romafo
Jehovah God certainly does not consider women as mere showpieces
Ɛda adi sɛ Yehowa Nyankopɔn mmu mmea sɛ abɔde a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ kɛkɛ
In Israel God s laws applied with equal force to both men and women who were guilty of adultery incest bestiality and other crimes
Wɔ Isreal no na wɔde Onyankopɔn mmara di mmarima ne mmea a wodi awaresɛe mogyafra mmoa a wɔne wɔn da ne nsɛmmɔnedi afoforo ho fɔ no nyinaa ho dwuma pɛpɛɛpɛ
Women could experience the benefits of the Sabbaths the laws governing Nazirites the festivals and many other provisions of the Law
Na mmea betumi anya Homeda Ahotuafo ho mmara afahyɛ horow ne Mmara no nsiesiei afoforo pii mu mfaso
The mother as well as the father was to be honored and obeyed
Leviticus Deuteronomy Proverbs
Na ɛsɛ sɛ wodi ɛna ne agya nyinaa ni yɛ osetie ma wɔn
Leviticus Deuteronomium Mmebusɛm
Verses to of Proverbs chapter honor a capable wife because of her faithfulness industriousness and wisdom in caring for her many responsibilities
Mmebusɛm ti no nkyekyem kosi di ɔyepa ni esiane ne nokwaredi nsiyɛ ne nyansa a ɔde di n’asɛyɛde pii no ho dwuma nti
She was duly recognized for her share in handling family business as well as other financial matters
Wɔkyerɛɛ obu kɛse maa no sɛ onya abusua adwuma ne sika ne nneɛma afoforo ho dwumadi mu kyɛfa
How different from the attitude of some men who think of women as mere ornaments !	Hwɛ sɛnea eyi yɛ soronko wɔ mmarima bi a wobu mmea sɛ adwinni bi kɛkɛ no ho !
Later in the early Christian congregation women were empowered with holy spirit as witnesses of Christ
Akyiri yi wɔ tete Kristofo asafo no mu wɔde honhom kronkron hyɛɛ mmea den sɛ Kristo adansefo
Thus some women are destined to become heavenly judges of men women and even angels
Enti mmea bi bebu mmarima mmea ne abɔfo mpo atɛn wɔ soro
True women were not to teach in congregational assembly nevertheless there were situations when Christian women could pray or prophesy
Ɛwom na ɛnsɛ sɛ mmea kyerɛkyerɛ wɔ asafo nhyiam horow ase nanso na Kristofo mmea betumi abɔ mpae anaa wɔahyɛ nkɔm wɔ tebea horow bi mu
They were assigned to be teachers of younger women children and to those outside the congregation
Matthew Corinthians Titus compare Psalm
Wɔde hyɛɛ wɔn nsa sɛ wɔnkyerɛkyerɛ mmabaa mmofra ne wɔn a wɔwɔ asafo no akyi no
Mateo Korintofo Tito fa toto Dwom ho
Another good indicator of what Peter had in mind when he said to assign them honor is found at Peter
Yehu biribi foforo a ɛkyerɛ nea na ɛwɔ Petro adwenem bere a ɔkae sɛ wonni wɔn ni no wɔ Petro
There we read that Jehovah honored Jesus by expressing his approval of him in the presence of others by stating This is my son my beloved
Yɛkenkan wɔ hɔ sɛ Yehowa hyɛɛ Yesu anuonyam bere a ɔdaa no adi wɔ afoforo anim sɛ n’ani sɔ no na ɔkaa eyi no Oyi ne me dɔba a ɔsɔ m’ani
Similarly a husband should show by his deeds both in public and in private that he assigns his wife honor
Saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ okunu de ne nneyɛe kyerɛ wɔ baguam ne kokoam nyinaa sɛ odi ne yere ni
Heirs of Life	Nkwa Difo
Throughout history men have often viewed women as worthy of little honor or respect as a slave or as a mere instrument for gratifying men
Wɔ abakɔsɛm nyinaa mu no mmarima taa bu mmea sɛ wɔmfata nidi anaa obu kɛse sɛ afenaa anaa adwinnade bi kɛkɛ a mmarima de dwudwo wɔn akɔnnɔ ano
The Christian concept of assigning honor to women certainly elevates them to a higher level of respect
Ɛda adi sɛ Kristofo adwene a ɛne sɛ wonni mmea ni no pagyaw wɔn ma wonya obu kɛse
Barnes Notes on the New Testament observes that Peter s admonition contains a very important truth in regard to the female sex
Barnes ’ Notes on the New Testament ka sɛ Petro afotu no kura mmea ho nokwasɛm bi a ɛho hia yiye
Under every other system of religion but the Christian system woman has been regarded as in every way inferior to man
Wɔabu ɔbea sɛ ɔba fam sen ɔbarima wɔ ɔkwan biara so wɔ nyamesom biara mu gye Kristosom mu nko
Christianity teaches that
she is entitled to all the hopes and promises which religion imparts
Kristosom kyerɛkyerɛ sɛ
ɔfata sɛ onya anidaso ne bɔhyɛ ahorow a nyamesom de ma no nyinaa bi
This single truth would raise the female sex everywhere from degradation and check at once half the social evils of the race
Saa nokwasɛm biako pɛ yi remma wommu ɔbea animtiaa bio wɔ baabiara na ɛde adesamma asetra mu nnebɔne mu fa bɛba awiei ntɛm ara
Since Christ has ownership of both men and women there is serious reason for husbands to cherish their wives as Christ s property
Esiane sɛ mmarima ne mmea nyinaa yɛ Kristo dea nti ɛyɛ asɛm a anibere wom sɛ okununom bu wɔn yerenom sɛ Kristo agyapade
Immediately after referring to women as the weaker vessel Peter s words continue Since you are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life in order for your prayers not to be hindered
Bere a Petro kaa mmea ho asɛm sɛ anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw wiei pɛ ne nsɛm no toaa so sɛ Efisɛ mo nso mo ne wɔn yɛ nkwa dom no difo bi na mo mpaebɔ kwan ansiw
Peter indicated that a husband s mistreating his wife would injure his relationship with God blocking his prayers
Petro kyerɛe sɛ ayayade a okunu bɛyɛ ne yere no bɛsɛe ɔne Onyankopɔn ntam abusuabɔ na asiw ne mpaebɔ kwan
In no way is the term weaker vessel meant to insult women
Wɔmfa asɛm anwenne a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no mmu mmea animtiaa wɔ ɔkwan biara so
While Jehovah set husbands as the head of the household he does not subscribe to men mistreating women
Ɛwom sɛ Yehowa paw okununom sɛ abusua no ti de nanso ɔmpene so sɛ mmarima nyɛ mmea ayayade
Instead he directs that the man with knowledge of the woman should extend care and honor to her
Mmom no ɔhyɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ ɔbea no ho nimdeɛ no hwɛ no na odi no ni
The Bible directs both married and single men to assign honor to women not treating them as lesser persons
Bible no hyɛ mmarima awarefo ne ahokwafo nyinaa sɛ wonni mmea ni na ɛnsɛ sɛ wobu wɔn sɛ nnipa a wɔba fam
Men and women who earnestly worship God and who dignify one another will receive rich blessings from the hand of God
Compare Corinthians
Mmarima ne mmea a wɔyere wɔn ho som Onyankopɔn na wodi wɔn ho wɔn ho ni no benya nhyira pii afi Onyankopɔn hɔ

Should I Marry the Father ?	Menware Abofra no Papa No ?
The Bible makes it clear that abortion is against God s law
Bible no da no adi pefee sɛ Onyankopɔn mmara tia nyinsɛn a wotu gu
It also teaches that a single mother has a responsibility to provide for her child in spite of the undesirable circumstances of the child s conception
Ɛkyerɛkyerɛ nso sɛ ɛyɛ ɛna a onni ɔhokafo no asɛyɛde sɛ ɔhwɛ ne ba no ɛmfa ho sɛ ɔnam ɔkwan a ɛmfata so na onyinsɛnee abofra no
In most cases it is best for the girl to raise the child herself rather than put it up for adoption
Mpɛn pii no eye sɛ abeawa no ankasa bɛtete ne ba no sen sɛ ɔde bɛhyɛ obi nsa
In view of the hardships that raising a child by herself can bring some mothers may feel it would be wise to marry the father of the child
Esiane ahokyere a abofra no a n’ankasa bɛtete no betumi de aba nti ebia ɛnanom binom bɛte nka sɛ nyansa wom sɛ wɔbɛware abofra no papa no
But many teenage fathers feel little obligation to either the child or its mother

Besides most young fathers are still of school age and unemployed
Afei nso agyanom nkumaa dodow no ara da so ara yɛ mmofra a wɔnyɛ adwuma
Entering into what one researcher calls a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely to prevent an out of wedlock birth may only make a bad situation worse

Remember too that the Bible directs Christians to marry only in the Lord

Realizing this Linda mentioned at the outset decided against marrying the year old father of her child
Bere a Linda a yɛkaa ne ho asɛm mfiase no huu eyi no wanware ne ba no papa a wadi mfe no
She explains He had no interest in God or the Bible
Ɔkyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Na onni Onyankopɔn anaa Bible no ho anigye biara
This does not necessarily mean leaving the young father out of the picture entirely
Eyi nso nkyerɛ sɛ wobebu ani agu agya a onnyinii no so koraa
As the young child gets older he may want to know his biological father
Bere a abofra no renyin no ebia ɔbɛpɛ sɛ ohu ne papa ankasa
Or it may be that the young father or his parents feel some moral obligation to have a relationship with the child or to provide some financial support
Anaasɛ ebetumi aba sɛ agya a onnyinii no anaa n’awofo benya nkate bi sɛ ɛyɛ wɔn asɛyɛde sɛ wɔne abofra no nya abusuabɔ anaa wɔhwɛ no wɔ sika fam

Ɛwom sɛ wo a wobɛwo bere a wonwaree no yɛ den de nanso ɛnyɛ ade a obi ntumi nyɛ ho hwee
God forgives in a large way those who repent of their wrongs
Onyankopɔn de wɔn a wonu wɔn ho wɔ wɔn nnebɔne ho no bɔne firi wɔn kɛse
’
Meditating on this can help a single mother overcome feelings of self loathing that may come over her at times
Eyi a ɛna a onni ɔhokafo besusuw ho no betumi aboa no ma wadi ɛyaw a ebia obedi bere ne bere mu no so
When feeling discouraged she can lean upon Jehovah and approach him in prayer
Sɛ ɔyɛ basaa a obetumi de ne ho ato Yehowa so na wabɛn no wɔ mpaebɔ mu
She can also implore God s help in rearing her child
Compare Judges
Obetumi asrɛ Onyankopɔn mmoa nso wɔ ne ba no ntetee ho
Fa toto Atemmufo ho
Jehovah also provides support through the Christian congregation
Yehowa nam Kristofo asafo no nso so de mmoa ma
Though Jehovah s Witnesses do not condone immorality they give consideration to those who repentantly make changes in their lives in order to please God
Ɛwom sɛ Yehowa Adansefo nhyɛ ɔbrasɛe ho nkuran de nanso wosusuw wɔn a wofi ahonu mu yɛ nsakrae wɔ wɔn asetram sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔbɛsɔ Onyankopɔn ani no ho
Some in the congregation may be moved to find discreet ways to render some practical assistance to a single parent
Ebia ɛbɛka asafo no mufo binom ma wɔahwehwɛ anifere akwan a wɔbɛfa so de mmoa a mfaso wɔ so ama ɔwofo bi a onni ɔhokafo
Compare Deuteronomy James
Fa toto Deuteronomium Yakobo ho
At the very least they can provide friendship and a hearing ear when it is needed
Anyɛ yiye koraa no wobetumi afa no adamfo na wɔayɛ aso atie no bere a ohia sɛ obi tie no no
Although the parents committed a serious sin the child is blameless
Ɛwom sɛ awofo no yɛɛ bɔne a anibere wom de nanso abofra no ho nni asɛm
So the congregation can help if the mother shows a right attitude
Enti sɛ ɛna no yi su pa adi a asafo no betumi aboa
How much better it is not to violate God s laws in the first place !	Hwɛ sɛnea eye sɛ obi mmu Onyankopɔn mmara so koraa !
But erring ones who have repented of their wayward course and have acted accordingly can be assured of Jehovah s help in making the most of their situation
Nanso wɔn a wɔfa akwammɔne so a wɔanu wɔn ho na wɔayɛ wɔn ade sɛnea ɛsɛ no betumi anya Yehowa mmoa de adi wɔn tebea no ho dwuma kɛse

Red Sea Wonders Beneath the Waves	Anwonwade wɔ Po Kɔkɔɔ no Ase
People say that beauty is only skin deep
Nkurɔfo ka sɛ ahoɔfɛ betumi ayɛ honam ani ade ara kwa
But real beauty often lies beneath the surface and this doesn t just apply to people
Nanso ahoɔfɛ ankasa wɔ komam na eyi mfa nnipa nkutoo ho
I discovered this to be true in the case of the Red Sea
Mihuu nokware a eyi yɛ wɔ Po Kɔkɔɔ no ho
The barren coastline gave me no inkling of the incredible beauty awaiting the fortunate swimmer who peers beneath the surface of its waters
Mpoano a ɛhɔ pradadada no amma mannya adwene bi wɔ n’ahoɔfɛ a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛretwɛn osuguarefo a onya hokwan kɔhwɛ ne bun mu no
THE Red Sea has a reputation for being one of the most interesting sites in the world for exploring the wonders of the coral reef
PO KƆKƆƆ no agye din sɛ wiase mmeae a ɛyɛ anigye yiye a wɔhwehwɛ nsu mu abotan fɛfɛ mu anwonwade ahorow no biako
So I was keen to see firsthand if its fame was justified

Once I had seen the underwater world for myself I wanted to understand it better

Marine biologist Aaron Miroz an expert on the marine life of the Red Sea answered my questions
Nsu mu abɔde a nkwa wom ho ɔdenimfo Aaron Miroz a waben wɔ Po Kɔkɔɔ mu abɔde ho no yiyii me nsemmisa ano
Why are the waters of the Red Sea so prolific ?	Dɛn nti na nsunam pii wɔ Po Kɔkɔɔ mu saa ?
 The Red Sea looks and acts like a huge bottleneck collecting many fish of the Indian Ocean
Po Kɔkɔɔ no te sɛ beae bi a ɛhɔ kyere so na ɛtwetwe mpataa fi India Po no mu
Furthermore we have here an extraordinary abundance of corals
Afei nso yɛwɔ afifide afɛfɛ soronko pii wɔ ha
On the reef you can often find as many as different species of corals growing on just one square yard of rock
Mpɛn pii na wubetumi ahu nsu mu afifide yi ahorow bɛyɛ a afifi wɔ abotan no baabi a ne kɛse bɛyɛ sɛ mita biako so
What encourages coral growth is the ideal water temperature which only varies by a few degrees throughout the year
Ade a ɛma nsu mu afifide no nyin ne nsu no mu ɔhyew a ɛfata a nsakrae ketewaa bi pɛ na ɛbam wɔ afe no mu no
Furthermore the low rainfall in the area means that little sediment enters the sea
Afei nso nsu a ɛntɔ wɔ ha kɛse no nso kyerɛ sɛ dontori kakraa bi pɛ na ɛkɔ po no mu
This in turn reduces the amount of pollutants although I regret to say that during the last years the situation has worsened

What are the problems in safeguarding this marine treasure ?	Dɛn na ɛma ɛyɛ den sɛ wɔbɛbɔ nsu mu abɔde yi ho ban ?
 When dealing with a relatively unspoiled habitat pollution is the greatest problem
Efi ne ɔhaw a emu yɛ den wɔ atrae a wɔnsɛee no kɛse no ho dwumadi mu

 We have discovered that fish have their feeding schedules
Yɛahu sɛ mpataa wɔ bere a wodidi
Some start feeding at seven o clock in the morning feed for three hours have a break and then feed for another three hours in the afternoon
Ebinom fi ase didi anɔpa nnɔnson wɔde nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa didi na wogye wɔn ahome na afei wɔde nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa foforo adidi awiabere
Some feed only at night
Ebinom didi anadwo nkutoo
These schedules are important
Saa nhyehyɛe yi ho hia
If smaller fish were under constant pressure from predators throughout the day they would be hard pressed to feed themselves
Sɛ mpataa a wɔkyere afoforo we no taa nketewa no pɛ sɛ wɔkyere wɔn bere nyinaa wɔ ɛda no mu a anka nketewa no nnya kwan nnidi
And fish like humans can be fussy eaters
Na te sɛ nnipa no mpataa nso tumi sa nnuan mu
The blue spotted grouper for example has a particular fancy for the fairy basslets which are very common in the Red Sea
Sɛ nhwɛso no mpataa akɛse a wɔn ho asisi bruu no ani gye mpataa nketewa a wɔn ho nhwinhwi a wɔdɔɔso wɔ Po Kɔkɔɔ no mu no ho
Our fish in the aquarium also have their favorite food some like tuna while others prefer sardines
Mpataa a wɔwɔ yɛn abura mu no nso wɔ aduan a wɔpɛ ebinom pɛ odaa bere a afoforo pɛ mman
You might think that to a fish all humans look alike but that is not the case
Ebia wubesusuw sɛ apataa ntumi nhyɛ nnipa nsow nanso ɛnte saa
Fish and even some invertebrates learn to recognize people
Mpataa ne nsunam bi a wonni berɛmo nnompe mpo tumi hyɛ nnipa nsow
I remember an octopus who was once playfully slapped by one of our staff
Mekae sɛ bere bi yɛn dwumayeni bi bɔɔ posena bi agoru so
He didn t like being slapped and he never again accepted food from that person
Wampɛ na wannye saa nipa no aduan bio
Incidentally we have found that mild people work best with fish whereas an aggressive or impatient person makes them nervous
Yɛahu sɛ nnipa a wodwo tumi yɛ mpataa ho adwuma yiye bere a wɔn a wɔn ani yɛ den anaa wonni boasetɔ ma ehu ka wɔn
What impresses a novice diver is the incredible variety of beauty and color
Ade a obi a ɔdɔ asukɔ foforo ani gye ho ne nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ ne kɔla ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa no
Sure enough the colorful fish are impressive
Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ mpataa a wɔn ho yɛ kɔla ahorow no ho yɛ anika
But what many do not realize is that some fish use their colors as signals somewhat like we use traffic lights
Nanso ade a nnipa pii nnim ne sɛ mpataa bi de wɔn kɔla ahorow no di dwuma sɛ nsɛnkyerɛnne te sɛ nea yɛde kanea a ɛkyerɛ kar kwan di dwuma no
For example when the red grouper is hunting rather than merely keeping watch over his territory his color turns a darker shade of red
Sɛ nhwɛso no sɛ apataa kɛse kɔkɔɔ no rekɔ ahayɔ a ne honam ani bere dum sen bere a ɔrehwɛ n’asasesin so ara kwa no
The clown fish which is preyed upon by the grouper can tell from the grouper s color when he is off duty
Apataa bi a wɔfrɛ no clown fish a apataa kɛse kɔkɔɔ no kyere no we no tumi gyina ne kɔla so hu bere a ɔnyɛ ha no
’
During these safe periods a clown fish will boldly chase away a grouper who invades his territory
Na wɔ saa mmere yi a asiane nnim mu no sɛ ɔkɔ clown fish no asasesin mu a ɔde akokoduru bɛpam no
No doubt about it the extraordinary beauty of God s creation can be discovered in many unlikely places

My life was enriched by exploring just a tiny sample of this beauty

They were summarily fired for their insubordination in taking such a stand

Toad Smoking Succeeds Toad Licking 	 Apɔtorɔ ho Wusiw a Wɔtwe Si Apɔtorɔ ho Nsu a Wɔtaforo Ananmu
Reportedly it has long been known by some in the drug culture that certain toads ooze from their skin a hallucinogenic chemical called bufotenine

However the chemical is also toxic so much so that it sometimes kills dogs who catch and eat the toads
Nanso aduru no yɛ awuduru araa ma ɛtɔ da bi a ekunkum akraman a wɔkyere mpɔtorɔ we no
Therefore reports The Wall Street Journal some drug users have been scared away from toad licking and have resorted instead to toad smoking

Hippopotamus to the Rescue !	Susono Gye Nkwa !
WEIGHING up to four tons the hippopotamus is the second largest living land mammal
SUSONO a ne mu duru tumi du tɔn anan no ne asase kesee so aboa a ɔto so abien a ɔso sen biara
Its powerful jaws can break apart a canoe in a single bite
N’apantan a ɛyɛ den no betumi ama wawae ɔkorow mu abien prɛko pɛ
Thus a group of men at Hwange National Park Zimbabwe were quite surprised when they saw a hippo behave in a way that struck them as out of character to say the least
Enti mmarima kuw bi a wɔwɔ Hwange National Park Zimbabwe ho dwiriw wɔn ara yiye bere a wohui sɛ susono bi yɛɛ ade wɔ ɔkwan bi so a ɛnyɛ saa na ɔyɛ n’ade no sɛ yɛnka mma ɛntra so a
The men while near a dam saw two impalas being hotly pursued by nine wild dogs
Bere a na mmarima no wɔ ɔtare bi ho no wohui sɛ adompo akron retaa adowa abien bi denneennen
Finding no escape route the impalas plunged into the water
Bere a adowa no nnya baabi a wobeguan afa no wɔtɔɔ nsu no mu
The dogs trotted along the edge of the water anticipating where the impalas would likely emerge
Adompo no tuu mmirika faa nsu no ano hwɛɛ baabi a adowa no bepue afi nsu no mu afa
Eventually one exhausted impala began swimming for a far shore without realizing that the dogs were there waiting
Awiei koraa no adowa no biako a wabrɛ fii ase guare kɔɔ nsu no ano nohɔ a na onnim sɛ adompo no retwɛn no
As the impala neared land however the men saw a nearby hippopotamus swimming toward the impala
Nanso bere a adowa no bɛnee asukɔn so no mmarima no hui sɛ susono bi a ɔbɛn hɔ reguare bɛn adowa no
Upon reaching it reports the magazine African Wildlife the hippo turned it around and compelled it with a gentle nudge to swim in the opposite direction
Nsɛmma nhoma African Wildlife bɔ amanneɛ sɛ bere a susono no duu ne nkyɛn no ɔdanee adowa no ani kyerɛɛ ɔfa foforo na opiaa no brɛoo sɛ onguare nkɔ baabi a ofi bae no
The impala obeyed
Adowa no yɛɛ saa
The hippo followed giving an occasional nudge when the impala showed signs of unsteadiness
Susono no dii n’akyi na sɛ ohu sɛ adowa no ntumi nkɔ yiye a na wapia no
As the impala reached the water s edge the men watched the hippo gently but firmly propel the impala ashore
Mmarima no hui sɛ bere a adowa no duu nsu no ano no susono no soo no mu brɛoo piaa no too asukɔn so
The impala took a few faltering steps then stopped and stood shivering
Adowa no tutuu anammɔn kakra a na ne nan rekeka bom afei ogyinaa hɔ a na ne ho rewosow
Soon the impala began walking away from the water
Ankyɛ adowa no fii ase nantew fii nsu no mu kɔe
The hippo followed until both disappeared from view
Susono no dii n’akyi araa kosii sɛ wɔanhu wɔn abien no bio
What happened to the other impala ?	Dɛn na ɛtoo adowa biako a waka no ?
The men report that the wild dogs had been so engrossed in watching the rescue that the other impala had escaped unnoticed

Religion Takes Sides	Nyamesom Gyina Ɔfa bi Akyi
ON September Germany invaded Poland starting World War II

Three weeks later The New York Times carried the headline German Soldiers Rallied by Churches

Did German churches really support Hitler s wars ?	So Germany asɔre ahorow no boaa Hitler akodi no ampa ?
Friedrich Heer Roman Catholic professor of history at Vienna University acknowledged that they did In the cold facts of German history the Cross and the swastika came ever closer together until the swastika proclaimed the message of victory from the towers of German cathedrals swastika flags appeared round altars and Catholic and Protestant theologians pastors churchmen and statesmen welcomed the alliance with Hitler

Indeed church leaders gave unqualified support to Hitler s war effort as Roman Catholic professor Gordon Zahn wrote The German Catholic who looked to his religious superiors for spiritual guidance and direction regarding service in Hitler s wars received virtually the same answers he would have received from the Nazi ruler himself

The New York Times of December reported In the past local Catholic hierarchies almost always supported the wars of their nations blessing troops and offering prayers for victory while another group of bishops on the other side publicly prayed for the opposite outcome

Susuw eyi ho hwɛ Wɔ December bere a Wiase Ko II fii ase akyi asram abiɛsa pɛ no Pope Pius XII kyerɛw asɔfo krataa Asperis Commoti Anxietatibus
The letter was addressed to chaplains in armies of the warring nations and it urged those on both sides to have confidence in their respective military bishops

The letter admonished the chaplains as fighters under the flags of their country to fight also for the Church
Krataa no tuu asɔfo no fo sɛ sɛ nkurɔfo a wɔreko ma wɔn man no wɔnko mma Asɔre no nso
Religion often takes an aggressive lead in mobilizing countries for war

It should be stated that already a thousand years have passed since the Pope decided to eliminate the Orthodox religion as a rivalry

On the other hand the Orthodox Church has backed the Serbs in their fighting

Fred Schmidt declared in the San Antonio Express News that the UN Security Council should pass a formal resolution calling on the pope the patriarch of Constantinople and the other leaders of the Catholic Eastern Orthodox and Muslim churches having jurisdiction in Bosnia Herzegovina to forthwith call off their dogs and meet together to figure out how their faithful can find it in their hearts to live as neighbors with those of other faiths

In a similar vein a commentary in the Scottsdale Arizona Progress Tribune concluded that the war might be stopped if the religious leaders over there got serious about stopping it

However popes have consistently refused to excommunicate the worst of war criminals even when fellow Catholics have appealed for such action to be taken

Fifteen Roman Catholic bishops from the African nations of Burundi Rwanda Tanzania Uganda and Zaire confessed that despite the presence of many baptized Christians in the region internal conflicts have led to massacres destruction and forced removals of people

True Christians and War	Nokware Kristofo ne Akodi
JESUS told his disciples I am giving you a new commandment that you love one another just as I have loved you that you also love one another
YESU ka kyerɛɛ n’asuafo no sɛ Ahyɛde foforo na mema mo sɛ monnodɔ mo ho sɛnea medɔɔ mo no sɛ mo nso monnodɔ mo ho mo ho ! 
Can true Christians manifest such love for one another and at the same time go to war and kill one another ?	So nokware Kristofo betumi ada ɔdɔ a ɛte saa adi akyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho na bere koro no ara wɔakɔ ko akokunkum wɔn ho wɔn ho ?

Really we should not be surprised to learn that early Christians did not go to war
Nokwarem no ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa sɛ yebehu sɛ tete Kristofo no ankɔ ko
Hastings renowned Encyclop dia of Religion and Ethics noted The view was widely prevalent in the early Church that war is an organized iniquity with which the Church and the followers of Christ can have nothing to do
Hastings Encyclop dia of Religion and Ethics a agye din no kae sɛ Na tete Asɔre no mufo pii kura adwene a ɛne sɛ ɔko yɛ bɔne ho nhyehyɛe a Asɔre no ne Kristo akyidifo no ntumi mfa wɔn ho nhyem ɔkwan biara so
Early Christians lived by Jesus command to love one another
Tete Kristofo traa ase sɛnea Yesu ahyɛde a ese wɔnnodɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho no kyerɛ no
The German theologian Peter Meinhold explained While the New Testament is silent on the question whether Christians may or may not be soldiers and whether they must resign from the army when they become Christians the old church took a stand in the issue
Germanni nyamekyerɛfo Peter Meinhold kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ Bere a Apam Foforo no nka sɛ ebia Kristofo betumi ayɛ asraafo anaasɛ wontumi nyɛ ne sɛ ebia bere a wɔbɛyɛ Kristofo no ɛsɛ sɛ wogyae asraadi ho asɛm no tete asɔre no sii asɛm no ho gyinae
Being a Christian and a soldier was considered irreconcilable
Na wobu yɛ a obi bɛyɛ Kristoni na wasan ayɛ ɔsraani no sɛ ade a entumi nyɛ yiye
Does anyone today take a stand like that of the old church ?	So obi wɔ hɔ nnɛ a osi gyinae bi te sɛ tete asɔre no de no ?

Encyclopedia Canadiana says The work of Jehovah s Witnesses is the revival and re establishment of the primitive Christianity practised by Jesus and his disciples during the first and second centuries of our era

 Jehovah s Witnesses maintain a strict neutrality in time of war notes the Australian Encyclop dia

One German who was found guilty and executed was Alfred Rosenberg head of the Nazi Party s Foreign Affairs Department

I gather from that that the United States too arrested Jehovah s Witnesses during the war and that until December of them were still detained in camps
Mahu afi mu sɛ United States nso kyekyeree Yehowa Adansefo wɔ ɔko no mu na ɛde besi December no na wɔn mu da so gu nneduaban mu
It is true that Jehovah s Witnesses have been strictly neutral not taking sides in political disputes

The question is so absurd that it scarcely merits an answer

We Did Not Support Hitler s War	Yɛamfa Yɛn ho Anhyɛ Hitler Akodi no Mu
AS TOLD BY FRANZ WOHLFAHRT	SƐNEA FRANZ WOHLFAHRT KA KYERƐE
MY FATHER Gregor Wohlfahrt served in the Austrian army during World War I to and fought against Italy
ME PAPA Gregor Wohlfahrt somee sɛ Austria sraani wɔ Wiase Ko I no mu kosi na ɔko tiaa Italy
Altogether hundreds of thousands of Austrians and Italians were slaughtered
Sɛ wɔka ne nyinaa bom a wokunkum Austriafo ne Italiafo ɔpehaha pii
The horrors of that experience completely changed Father s outlook on religion and war
Saa osuahu no mu ahude no sakraa Paapa adwene koraa wɔ nyamesom ne akodi ho
Father saw Austrian priests bless the troops and he learned that Italian priests on the other side were doing the same
Paapa huu Austriafo asɔfo sɛ wɔrehyira asraafo dɔm na ɔtee sɛ Italiafo asɔfo a wɔwɔ ɔfa foforo no nso reyɛ saa ara
So he asked Why are Catholic soldiers urged to kill other Catholics ?	Enti obisae sɛ Dɛn nti na wɔhyɛ Katolek asraafo nkuran sɛ wonkunkum Katolekfo afoforo ?
Should Christians go to war against one another ? 	So ɛsɛ sɛ Kristofo ne wɔn ho di ako ? 
The priests had no satisfying answers

In they left the booklet Prosperity Sure which answered many of Father s questions

It showed from the Bible that the world was being controlled by an invisible ruler called Devil and Satan
Efi Bible no mu kyerɛe sɛ sodifo a aniwa nhu no bi a wɔfrɛ no Ɔbonsam ne Satan na ɔredi wiase no so
His influence on the religion politics and commerce of this world was responsible for the horrors Father saw in World War I

At long last Father had found the answers that he had been searching for

Jehovah is the Father of Jesus Christ

If they are spreading the message out of love for that God that is very good

I would accompany him on shorter trips

Despite his public ministry Father did not neglect his own family s spiritual needs

When students greeted him with Heil Hitler ! 	Sɛ sukuufo no kyia no sɛ Mo Hitler ! 
he showed displeasure and asked What s wrong with our faith ? 	a na ne bo fuw na obisa sɛ Dɛn na aba yɛn gyidi so ? 
I took advantage of the opportunity and inquired why Catholics use titles such as Your Eminence and Holy Father since Jesus said that all his followers are brothers
Mefaa hokwan no bisaa no nea enti a Katolekfo de abodin ahorow te sɛ Nea Ɔkorɔn ne Agya Kronkron di dwuma bere a Yesu kae sɛ n’akyidifo nyinaa yɛ anuanom no
The priest acknowledged that doing this was wrong and that he himself was in trouble for refusing to bow before the bishop and kiss his hand
Ɔsɔfo no gye toom sɛ saa a na wɔyɛ no nteɛ na ɔno ankasa anya asɛm esiane sɛ wankotow ɔsɔfopɔn no amfe ne nsa ho nti
Then I asked How is it possible to kill fellow Catholics with the blessing of the Church ? 	Afei mibisaa no sɛ Dɛn nti na etumi ba sɛ Asɔre no hyira so ma wokunkum wɔn mfɛfo Katolekfo ? 
 This is the greatest shame ! 	Ɔsɔfo no teɛɛm kae sɛ Eyi yɛ aniwude a ɛsen biara !

On March Hitler marched without resistance into Austria and soon made it a part of Germany

The churches quickly aligned themselves with him

In fact less than a week later all six Austrian bishops including Cardinal Theodore Innitzer signed a glowing solemn declaration in which they said that in the coming elections it is a must and national duty as Germans for us Bishops to vote for the German Reich

The following week a new priest replaced him

Some times I was reported to the Gestapo

Ɛwom sɛ anka Paapa betumi de apɔwmuden a na onni esiane ɔhaw ahorow a ohyiae wɔ Wiase Ko I mu nti no ayi ne ho ano de nanso ɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn a wobisabisaa no nsɛm no sɛ sɛ Kristoni no ɔmfa ne ho nhyɛ akodi mu bio sɛnea ɔyɛe bere a na ɔyɛ Katolekni no da
For this remark he was held for further investigation
Esiane saa asɛm yi a ɔkae nti wogyee no kaa hɔ yɛɛ nsɛm mu nhwehwɛmu foforo
One week later when Germany invaded Poland which started World War II he was taken to Vienna
Adapɛn abien akyi bere a Germany tow hyɛɛ Poland so ma ɛkɔfaa Wiase Ko II bae no wɔde no kɔɔ Vienna
While he was being held there the mayor of our district wrote claiming that Father was responsible for other Witnesses having refused to support Hitler and that therefore Father should be executed
Bere a ɔda hɔ no yɛn mantam hɔ amrado no kyerɛw krataa kɔkae sɛ Paapa na wamma Adansefo afoforo annyina Hitler akyi ma enti ɛsɛ sɛ wokum no
As a result Father was sent to Berlin and was soon afterward sentenced to be beheaded
Ɛno ma wɔde Paapa kɔɔ Berlin na ɛno akyi pɛɛ no wobuu no fɔ sɛ wontwa ne ti
He was kept in chains day and night in the Moabit jail
Woguu no mpokyerɛ awia ne anadwo wɔ Moabit afiase hɔ
In the meantime I wrote Father on behalf of the family and told him that we were determined to follow his faithful example
Saa bere no ara mu no migyinaa abusua no ananmu kyerɛw Paapa ka kyerɛɛ no sɛ yɛasi yɛn bo sɛ yebedi ne nokwaredi ho nhwɛso no akyi
Father generally was not an emotional man but we could see how he felt when his last letter to us was stained with tears
Na Paapa nyɛ obi a ɔtaa da ne nkate adi nanso na yetumi hu sɛnea ɔte nka bere a nusu guguu ne krataa a etwa to a ɔkyerɛw brɛɛ yɛn so no
He was so happy that we understood his stand
N’ani gyei kɛse sɛ yɛtee ne gyinaesi no ase
He sent words of encouragement mentioning each one of us individually by name and urging us to keep faithful
Ɔmaa yɛn nkuranhyɛ nsɛm bobɔɔ yɛn mu biara din hyɛɛ yɛn nkuran sɛ yɛnkɔ so nni nokware
His hope in the resurrection was strong
Na owusɔre mu anidaso a ɔwɔ no mu yɛ den
Besides Father about two dozen other Witnesses were being held in the Moabit jail
Na Adansefo afoforo bɛyɛ aduonu anan ka Paapa ho na wɔda Moabit afiase hɔ
High ranking officials of Hitler tried to persuade them to give up their faith but without success
Hitler mpanyimfo a wɔwowɔ dibea akɛse bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛdan wɔn ti ma wɔagyae wɔn gyidi no mu nanso anyɛ yiye
In December some Witnesses were executed
Wɔ December mu no wokum Adansefo bɛyɛ
Upon learning of Father s execution Mother expressed how thankful she was to Jehovah that He had given Father the strength to remain faithful until death
Bere a Maame tee sɛ wɔakum Paapa no ɔkae sɛ ɔda Yehowa ase kɛse sɛ Ɔmaa Paapa ahoɔden maa odii nokware kosii owu mu
My Tests Begin	Me Sɔhwɛ Ahorow Fi Ase
A few weeks later I was called up for work service but soon learned that the main activity was military training
Adapɛn kakraa bi akyi no wɔtoo nsa frɛɛ me sɛ memmɛyɛ kwasafo dwuma nanso ankyɛ na mibehui sɛ dwumadi titiriw no ne sraadi ho ntetee
I explained that I would not serve in the army but would do other work
Mekyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ menyɛ sraadi adwuma na mmom mɛyɛ nnwuma afoforo
However when I refused to sing Nazi fighting songs the officers became infuriated
Nanso bere a mepowee sɛ mɛto Nasi ɔsa ho nnwom no asraafo mpanyimfo no bo fuwii
The next morning I appeared in civilian clothes rather than in the army uniform we had been issued
Ade kyee anɔpa no sɛ anka mede asraafo atade a wɔde maa yɛn no bɛhyɛ no mehyɛɛ fie atade
The officer in charge said he had no alternative but to put me in the dungeon
Ɔwɛmfo panyin no kae sɛ ade a obetumi ayɛ me ara ne sɛ ɔde me bɛto nneduaban dan a emu yɛ sum no mu
There I subsisted on bread and water
Paanoo ne nsu na wɔde maa me wɔ hɔ
Later I was told there would be a flag saluting ceremony and I was warned that refusal to participate would result in my being shot
Akyiri yi wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ wɔbɛyɛ frankaakyia ho guasodeyɛ bi na wɔbɔɔ me kɔkɔ sɛ sɛ mamfa me ho anhyem a wɔbɛbɔ me tuo
On the training grounds were recruits as well as military officers
Na wɔn a wɔafa wɔn foforo ne asraafo mpanyimfo wɔ beae a wɔtete nkurɔfo no
I was commanded to walk by the officers and the swastika flag and give the Hitler salute
Wɔhyɛɛ me sɛ menkɔfa asraafo mpanyimfo no ne swastika frankaa no nkyɛn na menka Hitler nkyia no
Drawing spiritual strength from the Bible account of the three Hebrews I simply said Guten Tag Good day as I passed
Bere a minyaa honhom fam ahoɔden fii Bible mu asɛm a ɛfa Hebrifo baasa no ho mu no mekɔfaa hɔ na nea mekae ara ne sɛ Guten Tag Mema mo aha
I was ordered to march past again
Wɔhyɛɛ me ma mekɔfaa hɔ bio
This time I didn t say anything only smiled
Saa bere yi de manka hwee meserewee kɛkɛ
When four officers led me back to the dungeon they told me they were trembling because they expected that I would be shot
Bere a awɛmfo baanan san de me kɔɔ nneduaban dan a emu yɛ sum no mu no wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ na wɔn ho repopo efisɛ na wɔhwɛ kwan sɛ wɔbɛbɔ me tuo
How is it possible they asked that you were smiling and we were so nervous ? 	Wobisae sɛ Ɛyɛɛ dɛn na na woreserew na ehu kaa yɛn ? 
They said that they wished they had my courage
Wɔkae sɛ wɔn yam a anka wɔwɔ akokoduru te sɛ me
A few days later Dr
Almendinger a high ranking officer from Hitler s headquarters in Berlin arrived in the camp
Nna kakra bi akyi no Ɔbenfo Almendinger ɔsraani panyin a ɔwɔ dibea kɛse a ofi Hitler adwumayɛbea ti wɔ Berlin baa nneduaban no mu
I was called before him
Wɔfrɛɛ me kɔɔ n’anim
He explained that the laws had become much tougher
Ɔkyerɛkyerɛɛ me sɛ wɔamia mmara no mu koraa sen kan no
You are not aware at all of what you are in for he said
Ɔkae sɛ Wunnim nea ɛrebɛto wo ankasa
Oh yes I am I replied
Mibuae sɛ Oh minim
My father was beheaded for the same reason only a few weeks ago
Asɛm koro yi ara ho na wotwaa me papa ti adapɛn kakraa bi a atwam no
He was stunned and fell silent
Ne ho dwiriw no na ɔyɛɛ dinn
Later another high ranking official from Berlin arrived and further attempts were made to change my mind
Akyiri yi ɔsraani panyin foforo a ɔwɔ dibea kɛse fi Berlin bae na ɔno nso bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛma masesa m’adwene
After hearing why I would not break God s laws he took my hand and with tears streaming down his face said I want to save your life ! 	Bere a otiee nea enti a mempɛ sɛ mibu Onyankopɔn mmara ahorow so no osoo me nsa na bere a nusu sesa n’anim no ɔkae sɛ Mepɛ sɛ migye wo nkwa ! 
All the officers looking on were very moved
Ɛkaa awɛmfo a na wɔrehwɛ no nyinaa kɛse
I was then led back to the dungeon where I spent days altogether
Afei wɔsan de me kɔɔ dan a emu yɛ sum no mu na sɛ wɔka ne nyinaa bom a midii nnafua wɔ hɔ
Trial and Imprisonment	Asenni ne Afiasenna
In April I was transferred to a jail in Furstenfeld
Wɔde me kɔɔ afiase bi mu wɔ Furstenfeld wɔ March mu
A few days later my fiancee Maria and my brother Gregor visited
Nna kakraa bi akyi no me siyere Maria ne me nuabarima Gregor bɛsraa me
Gregor was only a year and a half younger than I and he had taken a firm stand for Bible truth in school
Na mesen Gregor panyin afe ne fa pɛ na na wagyina Bible mu nokware akyi pintinn wɔ sukuu mu
I remember his urging our younger brothers to be prepared for persecution saying there was only one way serving Jehovah !	Mekae sɛ ɔhyɛɛ yɛn nuabarimanom nkumaa no nkuran sɛ wonsiesie wɔn ho mma ɔtaa na ɔkae sɛ ɔkwan koro pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ yɛbɛsom Yehowa !
The precious hour spent encouraging one another was the last time I saw him alive
Dɔnhwerew biako a ɛsom bo a yɛde hyehyɛɛ yɛn ho yɛn ho nkuran no ne bere a etwa to a mihuu no sɛ ɔte nkwa mu
Later in Graz I was sentenced to five years of hard labor
Akyiri yi wobuu me fɔ wɔ Graz sɛ wɔmfa me ntom ma menyɛ adwumaden
In the fall of I was put on a train destined for a labor camp in Czechoslovakia but I was detained in Vienna and placed in prison there
Wɔ otwabere mu no wɔde me traa keteke bi mu sɛ wɔde me rekɔ nneduaban a wɔyɛ adwumaden wom wɔ Czechoslovakia nanso wogyee me kaa Vienna de me too afiase wɔ hɔ
The conditions were horrible
Na tebea no yɛ hu
Not only did I suffer from hunger but during the nights I was bitten by large bugs that left my flesh bleeding and burning
Ɛnyɛ ɔkɔm nko na ɛdee me na mmom na mpaboa akɛse we me anadwo ma me honam fi mogya na ɛyɛ me yaw
For reasons then unknown to me I was returned to prison in Graz
Wɔsan de me kɔɔ Graz afiase hɔ a saa bere no na minnim nea enti a wɔyɛɛ saa
There was interest in my case because the Gestapo described Jehovah s Witnesses as fanatical martyrs who wanted the death sentence so as to get a heavenly reward
Na ani wɔ m’asɛm no ho efisɛ Gestapofo no kaa Yehowa Adansefo ho asɛm sɛ wɔyɛ mogya adansefo a wɔnte hwee ase a wɔpɛ owu afobu na ama wɔanya ɔsoro akatua
As a result for two days I had a fine opportunity to speak before a professor and eight students from Graz University explaining that only persons would be taken to heaven to rule with Christ
Ne saa nti minyaa hokwan fɛfɛ de nnanu kasa kyerɛɛ ɔbenfo bi ne adesuafo baawɔtwe a wofi Graz Sukuupɔn mu na mekyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ nnipa pɛ na wɔde wɔn bɛkɔ soro ma wɔne Kristo akodi ade
My hope I said was to enjoy everlasting life in paradise conditions on earth
Psalm Revelation
Mekae sɛ m’anidaso ne sɛ menya daa nkwa wɔ asase so wɔ paradise tebea horow mu
Dwom Adiyisɛm
After two days of questioning the professor said I have come to the conclusion that you have both feet on this earth
Bere a ɔbenfo no bisabisaa me nsɛm nnanu no ɔkae sɛ Mabehu sɛ w’ani da fam
It is not your desire to die and go to heaven
Ɛnyɛ wo pɛ ne sɛ wubewu na woakɔ soro
He expressed sorrow about the persecution of Jehovah s Witnesses and wished me the best
Ɔdaa no adi sɛ ɛyɛ no awerɛhow sɛ wɔretaa Yehowa Adansefo na ɔkae sɛ ensi me yiye
Early in I found myself aboard a train headed for Rollwald hard labor camp in Germany
Wɔ mfiase no wɔde me traa keteke bi mu sɛ wɔde me rekɔ Rollwald nneduaban a wɔyɛ adwumaden wom mu wɔ Germany
Harsh Camp Life	Nneduaban mu Asetra a Ɛyɛ Den
Rollwald was located between the cities of Frankfurt and Darmstadt and held about prisoners
Na Rollwald wɔ Frankfurt ne Darmstadt nkurow no ntam na na nneduafo bɛyɛ na wɔda hɔ
Each day began at a
m
with roll call which took some two hours as officers took their time updating their prisoner list
Ade a edi kan a na wɔyɛ no da biara bere a abɔ anɔpa ne edin bobɔ a na edi bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien esiane sɛnea awɛmfo no tɔɔ wɔn bo ase yeyɛɛ nsakrae wɔ nneduafo no din a wɔakyerɛkyerɛw no mu nti
We were required to stand motionless and many prisoners suffered severe beatings for not standing perfectly still
Na wɔhwehwɛ sɛ yegyina hɔ dinn a yɛnkeka yɛn ho na wɔhwee nneduafo pii kɛse esiane sɛ wɔkekaa wɔn ho nti
Breakfast consisted of bread which was made of flour sawdust and potatoes that were often rotten
Paanoo a wɔde esiam mmerehua ne ntɔmmɔ a mpɛn pii no na aporɔw yɛe na na ɛyɛ anɔpaduan
Then we went to work in the swamp digging trenches to drain the land for agricultural purposes
Afei na yɛkɔyɛ adwuma wɔ ɔwora mu twitwa aka sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a asase no mu nsu bɛtwe ma wɔde ayɛ kua
After we worked in the swamp all day without adequate footwear our feet would swell up like sponges
Sɛ yɛde da mu nyinaa yɛ adwuma wɔ ɔwora no mu wɔ bere a yɛnhyɛ mpaboa papa biara a na yɛn nan ase honhon te sɛ sapɔw
Once my feet developed what appeared to be gangrene and I feared they would need to be amputated
Bere bi me nan ase yɛɛ te sɛ nea ɔyare bɔne bi ayɛ me na misuroe sɛ ebia ebehia sɛ wotwa
At noon on the job site we were served an experimental concoction of so called soup
Sɛ edu owigyinae a na wɔma yɛn afrafraduan bi a wɔresɔ ahwɛ a na wɔfrɛ no nkwan wɔ baabi a yɛyɛ adwuma no
It was flavored with turnip or cabbage and sometimes included the ground carcasses of diseased animals
Na wɔde turnip anaa ɛfan tom na ɛtɔ da bi a na wɔyam mmoa a wɔyare nam fra mu
Our mouths and throats burned and many of us developed large boils
Yɛn ano ne yɛn menem hyehyew yɛn na mpɔmpɔ akɛse bobɔɔ yɛn mu pii
In the evening we received more soup
Edu anwummere a na wɔma yɛn nkwan no bio
Many prisoners lost their teeth but I had been told the importance of keeping teeth active
Nneduafo pii se tutui nanso na wɔaka sɛnea ɛho hia sɛ yɛde yɛn se bedi dwuma yiye no akyerɛ me
I would chew on a piece of pine wood or on hazel twigs and I never lost mine
Na mewe pine ne hazel duaa na me de antutu da
Keeping Strong Spiritually	Honhom mu Ahoɔden a Mikura Mu
In an effort to break my faith the guards isolated me from contact with other Witnesses
Bere a na awɛmfo no rebɔ mmɔden ama magyae me mudi mu no wɔtew me fii Adansefo afoforo ho
Since I had no Bible literature I would call to mind scriptures I had memorized such as Proverbs which urges us to trust in Jehovah with all our heart and Corinthians which promises that Jehovah will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear
Esiane sɛ na minni Bible ho nhoma biara nti na mekaakae kyerɛw nsɛm a masua agu me tirim te sɛ Mmebusɛm a ɛhyɛ yɛn nkuran sɛ yɛmfa yɛn koma nyinaa nto Yehowa so ’ ne Korintofo a ɛhyɛ bɔ sɛ Yehowa remma wɔnsɔ yɛn nhwɛ ntra nea yebetumi asoa ’ no
By reviewing such scriptures in my mind and by leaning on Jehovah in prayer I was strengthened
Ɛdenam kyerɛw nsɛm a ɛtete saa a midwennwen ho ne Yehowa a mede me ho twerii no wɔ mpaebɔ mu so no minyaa ahoɔden
At times I was able to see a Witness who was in transit from another camp
Ɛtɔ mmere bi a na mitumi hu Ɔdansefo bi a wɔde no fi nneduaban foforo mu reba
If we did not have opportunity to speak we would encourage each other to stand firm with a nod of our head or a raised clenched fist
Sɛ yɛannya hokwan ammɔ nkɔmmɔ a na yɛbɔ yɛn ti nko anaa yemmua yɛn nsa de kyerɛ soro de hyɛ yɛn ho nkuran sɛ yennyina pintinn
Occasionally I received letters from Maria and Mother
Na minya nkrataa fi Maria ne Maame hɔ wɔ bere ne bere mu
In one I learned of my dear brother Gregor s death and in another toward the end of the war of the execution of Hans Stossier Maria s brother
Emu biako mu na mihui sɛ me nua Gregor a medɔ no no awu na bere a ɔko no rekɔ n’awiei no mihui wɔ foforo mu nso sɛ wɔakum Hans Stossier Maria nuabarima no
Later a prisoner was transferred to our camp who knew Gregor when they were together in the Moabit jail in Berlin
Akyiri yi wɔde deduani bi baa yɛn nneduaban no mu a na onim Gregor wɔ Berlin Moabit afiase a na ɔne no da hɔ no mu
From him I learned details of what happened
Ɔkaa sɛnea asɛm no sii kyerɛɛ me
Gregor had been sentenced to die by guillotine but in an effort to break his integrity the customary waiting period before execution had been extended to four months
Wobuu Gregor fɔ sɛ wɔmfa abonnua ntwa ne ti nanso mmɔden a wɔbɔe sɛ wɔbɛma wagyae ne mudi mu nti wɔtoo nna a edii ansa na wɔrekum no no mu ma eduu asram anan
During that time all kinds of pressures were exerted to make him compromise heavy chains bound his hands and feet and he was rarely fed
Saa bere no wɔde nhyɛso ahorow nyinaa baa no so sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obegyae mu asiesie wɔde mpokyerɛ akɛse guu ne nan ne ne nsa nyinaa na na wɔntaa mma no aduan
Yet he never wavered
Nanso wanhinhim da
He was faithful to the end March
Odii nokware koduu awiei March
Though saddened by the news I was strengthened by it to remain faithful to Jehovah come what may
Ɛwom sɛ asɛm no yɛɛ me awerɛhow de nanso ɛhyɛɛ me den sɛ menkɔ so nni Yehowa nokware ɛmfa ho nea ɛbɛba biara
In time I also learned that my younger brothers Kristian and Willibald and my younger sisters Ida and Anni were taken to a convent used as a correctional home in Landau Germany
Bere kɔɔ so no metee nso sɛ wɔde me nuabarimanom nkumaa Kristian ne Willibald ne me nuabeanom nkumaa Ida ne Anni kɔɔ nkokorafi bi a ɛwɔ Landau Germany a wɔde ayɛ mmofra bɔne fie no mu
The boys were severely beaten because they refused to heil Hitler

Opportunities to Witness	Adansedi Hokwan Ahorow
Most of those in the barracks where I lived were political prisoners and criminals
Na nneduaban a mewom no mu nnipa no fa kɛse yɛ amammui mu nneduafo anaa amumɔyɛfo
I often spent evenings witnessing to them
Na metaa di wɔn adanse anwummere
One was a Catholic priest from Kapfenberg named Johann List
Na wɔn mu biako yɛ Katolek sɔfo bi a ofi Kapfenberg a wɔfrɛ no Johann List
He had been imprisoned because he had spoken to his congregation about things heard on British Broadcasting
Nea ɛmaa wɔde no bɛtoo nneduaban no mu ne sɛ ɔkaa nsɛm a ɔtee wɔ Britania Radio dwumadi bi mu kyerɛɛ n’asɔremma
Johann had a very difficult time because he was not accustomed to hard physical labor
Na ɛyɛ den yiye ma Johann efisɛ na honam fam adwumaden nkokwaw no
He was a pleasant man and I would help him reach his work quota so that he would not get into trouble
Na ne ho yɛ anika na na meboa no ma otumi yɛ adwuma a wɔatwa ama no no sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a asɛm nto no
He said he was ashamed that he was imprisoned for political reasons and not for standing up for Christian principles
Ɔkae sɛ ɛyɛ no aniwu sɛ amammuisɛm nti na wɔde no abɛtɔ nneduaban mu na ɛnyɛ sɛ ogyinaa Kristofo nnyinasosɛm ahorow akyi nti
You are really suffering as a Christian he said

When he was released about a year later he promised to visit my mother and my fiancee which promise he kept

Life for Me Improves	Me Tebea Yɛ Yiye Kakra
Late in we got a new camp commander by the name of Karl Stumpf a tall white haired man who started to improve conditions in our camp
Wɔ awiei no yenyaa nneduaban so panyin foforo bi a wɔfrɛ no Karl Stumpf ɔbarima tenten bi a ne ti nhwi fitaa a ofii ase maa yɛn nneduaban hɔ tebea no yɛɛ yiye kakra
His villa was due for painting and when he learned that I was a painter by trade I was given the job
Na ɔrebɛka ne fie ho na bere a ɔtee sɛ adwuma a masua ne dan ho ka no ɔde adwuma no maa me
That was the first time I was called away from working in the swamp
Ɛno ne bere a edi kan a wɔmaa me fii ɔwora no mu kɔyɛɛ adwuma wɔ baabi foforo
The commander s wife had a hard time understanding why I had been imprisoned even though her husband explained that I was there because of my faith as one of Jehovah s Witnesses
Na ɔpanyin no yere ntumi nte nea enti a wɔde me ato nneduaban hɔ no ase ɛwom sɛ ne kunu kyerɛkyerɛɛ no mu sɛ me gyidi sɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako nti na mewɔ hɔ de
She took pity on me because I was so skinny and fed me
Esiane sɛ na mafɔn yiye nti meyɛɛ no mmɔbɔ na ɔmaa me aduan dii
She arranged more jobs for me so I could be built up physically
Ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe ma minyaa nnwuma afoforo sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a metumi anya honam fam ahoɔden
When prisoners from the camp were being called for fighting on the front lines toward the end of my good relationship with Commander Stumpf saved me
Bere a na wɔrefa nneduafo afi nneduaban no mu ma wɔakɔko wɔ akono bere a na rekɔ n’awiei no abusuabɔ pa a na me ne Ɔpanyin Stumpf wɔ no bɔɔ me ho ban
I explained to him that I would suffer death before becoming bloodguilty by taking part in war
Mekyerɛkyerɛɛ no mu sɛ mepɛ sɛ miwu mmom sen sɛ menya akodi mu kyɛfa na madi mogya ho fɔ
Although my position of neutrality put him in an awkward position he was able to keep my name off the list of those called up
Ɛwom sɛ ɔfa biara a mannyina no nti na onhu nea ɔnyɛ de nanso otumi hwɛe ma wɔamfa me din anka wɔn a wɔrefa wɔn akɔ no ho
Last Days of the War	Ɔko no Nna a Etwa To
During January and February of low flying American planes encouraged us by dropping leaflets that said the war was near its end
Wɔ January ne February mu no Amerikafo wimhyɛn ahorow a na ɛnam fam pɛɛ no hyɛɛ yɛn nkuran denam nkrataa bi a wɔtoto guu fam a ɛkae sɛ ɔko no reba n’awiei no so
Commander Stumpf who had saved my life provided me civilian clothes and offered his villa as a hiding place
Ɔpanyin Stumpf a ogyee me nkwa no maa me ofie ntade na ɔkae sɛ minkohintaw ne fie
Leaving the camp I saw overwhelming chaos
Bere a mifii nneduaban no mu no mihuu basabasayɛ a na ɛyɛ ahodwiriw
For example children in battle gear with tears streaming down their faces were fleeing before the Americans
Sɛ nhwɛso no na mmofra a wɔhyehyɛ akotade a wɔresu reguan na Amerikafo no ammɛto wɔn
Fearing that I would run into SS officers who would wonder why I was not carrying a gun I decided to return to the camp
Esiane sɛ na misuro sɛ metumi ahyia SS ɔwɛmfo bi a ɔrente nea enti a minkura tuo ase nti misii gyinae sɛ mɛsan akɔ nneduaban no mu
Soon our camp was completely encircled by American troops
Ankyɛ na Amerikafo asraafo dɔm betwaa yɛn nneduaban no nyinaa ho hyiae
On March the camp surrendered flying white flags
Wɔ March no wɔde nneduaban no hyɛɛ wɔn nsa de frankaa fitaa sisii so
How surprised I was to learn that there were other Witnesses in camp extensions who also had been held back from execution by Commander Stumpf !	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛɛ me nwonwa sɛ metee sɛ Adansefo afoforo nso wɔ nneduaban no mu a Ɔpanyin Stumpf amma wɔankum wɔn !
What a joyous meeting we had !	Hwɛ anigye ara a yenyae bere a yehyiaam no !
When Commander Stumpf was jailed many of us approached the American officers and testified personally and by letter in his behalf
Bere a wɔde Ɔpanyin Stumpf too afiase no yɛn mu pii kɔɔ Amerikafo asraafo mpanyimfo no nkyɛn kɔpaa kyɛw maa no tee anaa denam krataa so
As a result three days later he was freed
Ɛno nti nnansa akyi no woyii no
To my astonishment I was the first one of the some prisoners allowed to go free
Nea ɛyɛɛ me nwonwa no me ne deduani a wodii kan gyaee no wɔ nneduafo bɛyɛ no mu
After five years of imprisonment I felt as if I were dreaming
Bere a na wɔde me ato mu mfe anum no ɛyɛɛ me sɛnea mereso dae
With tears of joy I thanked Jehovah in prayer for having preserved me alive
Anigye maa misui na mebɔɔ Yehowa mpae daa no ase sɛ wakora me nkwa so
Germany did not surrender until May about six weeks later
Germany amfi ne pɛ mu amfa ne ho anhyɛ atamfo no nsa kosii May bɛyɛ adapɛn asia akyi
On my release I immediately established contact with other Witnesses in the area
Woyii me akyi pɛɛ no mekɔhwehwɛɛ Adansefo afoforo a wɔwɔ mpɔtam hɔ no
A Bible study group was organized and during the following weeks I spent many hours witnessing to the people in the area surrounding the camp

At the same time I obtained employment as a painter

Back Home Again	Mesan Kɔ Fie Bio
In July I was able to buy a motorcycle and then my long trek home began
Wɔ July mu no mitumi tɔɔ moto na ɔkwan tenten a merebetwa akɔ fie no fii ase
The journey took several days since many of the bridges along the highway had been blown up

You can imagine the happy reunion

Mother threw down her scythe and also came running

Now years later Mother is years of age and blind

Her mind is still clear and she remains a faithful Witness of Jehovah

Maria and I were married in October and in the years since we have enjoyed serving Jehovah together

Courage to Endure	Akokoduru a Wɔde Gyina Mu
Many times I have been asked how as a mere youth I was able to face death without fear
Wɔabisa me mpɛn pii sɛ ɛyɛɛ dɛn na bere a na meyɛ abofra koraa no mitumi gyinaa owu tebea ano a mansuro
Be assured Jehovah God gives the strength to endure if you are determined to remain loyal
Nya awerɛhyem Yehowa Nyankopɔn de ahoɔden a wɔde gyina mu no ma sɛ woasi wo bo sɛ wobɛkɔ so adi nokware a
One learns very quickly to rely fully on him through prayer
Obi tumi sua no ntɛm sɛ ɔde ne ho bɛto ne so koraa denam mpaebɔ so
And knowing that others including my own father and brother endured faithfully to death served to help me remain loyal as well
Na nim a na minim sɛ afoforo te sɛ m’ankasa me papa ne me nuabarima de nokwaredi gyinaa mu kosii owu mu no boaa me maa me nso midii nokware
It was not only in Europe that Jehovah s people did not take sides in war
Ɛnyɛ Europa nko na Yehowa nkurɔfo amfa wɔn ho anhyɛ akodi mu
I remember that during the Nuremberg trials in one of Hitler s high ranking officials was being questioned about the persecution of Jehovah s Witnesses in concentration camps
Mekae sɛ bere a na wɔredi asɛm wɔ Nuremberg wɔ mu no wobisaa Hitler mpanyimfo a wɔwɔ dibea akɛse no biako asɛm faa Yehowa Adansefo a wɔtaa wɔn wɔ nneduaban mu no ho
He pulled from his pocket a news clipping that reported that thousands of Jehovah s Witnesses in the United States were in American prisons because of their neutrality during World War II

Indeed true Christians courageously follow the example of Jesus Christ who maintained integrity to God down to his dying breath
Nokwarem no nokware Kristofo de akokoduru di Yesu Kristo a okuraa ne mudi mu maa Onyankopɔn kosii sɛ oguu ahome a etwa to no nhwɛso akyi
To this day I often think of the members of our small congregation in St
Ɛde besi nnɛ no metaa kaakae nnipa a na wɔwɔ yɛn asafo ketewa a na ɛwɔ St
Martin during the s and s who out of love for God and their fellowman refused to support Hitler s war and for that reason were put to death

What a grand reunion it will be when they are brought back to enjoy life forevermore in God s new world !	Hwɛ da kɛse a ɛbɛyɛ sɛ yɛbɛsan ahyiam bere a wɔde wɔn san ba ma wobenya asetra a enni awiei wɔ Onyankopɔn wiase foforo no mu no !

THE teenager s father died when she was a child leaving her mother with a large family of eight children
ABABAA no papa wui bere a na ɔyɛ abofra na ogyaw ne maame abusua kɛse a mmofra baawɔtwe na wɔwom
Now that her mother is getting old the teenager must contribute to the support of the family by finding a job
Afei a ne maame rebɔ aberewa yi ɛsɛ sɛ ababaa no pɛ adwuma bi yɛ de boa abusua no
Finished is her dream of continuing school

She has to work even though she has no skills or formal education
Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ɛwom sɛ onsuaa adwuma biara anaasɛ onwiee sukuu de
Situations like this are common in developing countries

Jobs are scarce even for those with university degrees

Nevertheless with determination and a good sense of creativity many have been able to devise jobs for themselves
Nanso nnipa pii nam wɔn bo a wosi ne wɔn tirim a wotumi bɔ yɛ biribi pa so atumi abuebue wɔn ankasa nnwuma
Such jobs may not place a person in the lap of luxury but the Bible says at Timothy Having sustenance and covering we shall be content with these things

The Food Business African Style	Aduantɔn Sɛnea Afrikafo Yɛ No
Food is always in demand
Aduan yɛ ade a nkurɔfo hia bere nyinaa
Here in West Africa enterprising women have found a fascinating variety of ways to turn this fact into profit
Wɔ Afrika Atɔe Fam ha no mmea a wɔyɛ nsi ahu akwan horow a ɛyɛ anigye a wɔbɛfa so de nokwasɛm yi adi dwuma de anya mfaso
Some for example construct a small shed near a construction site and cook a noon meal for the workers
Sɛ nhwɛso no ebinom bɔ apata ketewaa bi wɔ beae bi a wɔreyɛ adwuma bi na wɔnoa aduan tɔn ma adwumayɛfo no awiabere
Others provide food for those on their way to work in the morning
Afoforo noa aduan tɔn ma wɔn a wɔrekɔ adwuma anɔpa
They set up a small table with benches boil water on a charcoal heater and serve a simple breakfast hot coffee with fresh bread and butter
Wɔde pon ketewa bi si hɔ de benkyi sisi ho sɔ gya noa nsu tɔn anɔpaduan a ne noa nyɛ den kɔfe a ɛyɛ hyew a paanoo ne bɔta ka ho
In the evening they set up shop again and serve a small meal to workers at the end of the day
Wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma no anwummere nso tɔn aduan a emu nyɛ duru ma adwumayɛfo a wɔapɔn adwuma no
Running this kind of restaurant means working a tough schedule but it allows industrious ones to pay their bills
Adidibea a ɛte saa a wɔyɛ no ma bere ho bɛyɛ den nanso ɛma wɔn a wɔpɛ adwuma no tumi hwɛ wɔn ho
There is also an opportunity for selling snack foods
Hokwan wɔ hɔ sɛ wɔbɛtɔn nnɔkɔnnɔkɔwade nso
Some women find a crowded place near a market and roast peanuts
Mmea binom hwehwɛ baabi a nnipa wɔ kɛse a ɛbɛn gua bi na wɔkyew nkate
Fatayas small meat pies served in a hot sauce are also easily sold
Fataya meat pie nketewa a wɔde abom a emu yɛ hyew hyem nso tɔn nyɛ den
So are meat sandwiches made with a spicy meat sauce
Saa ara na paanoo a wɔde nam ne abom a ɛyɛ dɛ hyehyɛ mu nso te
These are fast moving items in African countries such as The Gambia and Mali
Eyinom yɛ nneɛma a wɔtɔ no ntɛmntɛm wɔ Afrika aman te sɛ Gambia ne Mali mu
In Guinea Bissau and Senegal quite a number of young people who are Jehovah s Witnesses support themselves in the full time ministry by baking and selling another popular item small cakes
Wɔ Guinea Bissau ne Senegal no mmofra pii a wɔyɛ Yehowa Adansefo hwɛ wɔn ho wɔ bere nyinaa som adwuma no mu denam aduan foforo a agye din a wɔto na wɔtɔn so keeki
Moses a resident of Senegal s capital city Dakar explains My wife and I were serving as special pioneers full time evangelizers when we began having children
Moses a ɔte Senegal ahenkurow Dakar no kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Na me ne me yere resom sɛ akwampaefo atitiriw bere nyinaa asɛmpakafo bere a yefii ase woe
Now I had to find a way to support them so the idea came to me to make and sell small cakes
Afei na ɛsɛ sɛ mehwehwɛ ɔkwan bi a mɛfa so ahwɛ wɔn enti minyaa adwene bi sɛ mɛyɛ keeki nketewa atɔn
I had very little cash to start off with so I had to be careful to distinguish between money I could keep as profit and money I needed to put back into the business to replenish supplies such as flour and eggs
Na sika a mede refi ase no sua enti na ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye sɛ mehu sika a metumi de ato me ho sɛ me mfaso ne nea na mede bɛsan ayɛ adwuma no de atotɔ ɛho nneɛma te sɛ esiam ne nkesua
Now I am able to sell enough cakes to care for most of the needs of my small family
Mprempren mitumi tɔn keeki a ɛdɔɔso de di m’abusua ketewa no ahiade dodow no ara ho dwuma
To help out my wife Esther sews dresses at home
Me yere Esther pam ntade wɔ fie de boa
This permits her to be home with our two small boys
Eyi ma onya hokwan ne yɛn mmabarima nketewa baanu no tra fie
So between the two of us we are able to care quite well for our family despite the fact that we live in difficult times
Enti yɛn baanu tumi hwɛ yɛn abusua no yiye ɛmfa ho sɛ yɛte mmere a emu yɛ den mu no
Here s another idea for a small business Since working people are busy and often do not have time for a long trip to the market they will patronize small local stands that sell fruit or vegetables
Adwuma ketewa foforo bi a wobetumi afa ho adwene ni Esiane sɛ adwumayɛfo nni adagyew na mpɛn pii wonnya bere mfa ntwa kwan tenten nkɔ gua so nti wɔbɛtɔ nneɛma wɔ sotɔɔ nketewa a wɔyɛ wɔ wɔn mpɔtam hɔ a wɔtɔn nnuaba anaa atosode mu
Some stand owners even have a delivery service taking fresh vegetables right to the homes of customers
Sotɔɔ a ɛtete saa no wuranom binom de nneɛma no kɔ nkurɔfo nkyɛn wɔde atosode a wɔnnoae kɔ wɔn a wɔtɔ no afie mu pɛɛ
Word can spread quickly that you are honest and that you sell quality products
Ebetumi ahyeta ntɛm sɛ woyɛ nokwaredifo na wotɔn nneɛma pa
Be careful however not to charge too much or people will simply return to the regular market
Nanso hwɛ yiye na woamma wo nneɛma bo anyɛ den dodo ɛnte saa a nkurɔfo begyae wo hɔ nneɛma tɔ asan akɔ gua kɛse so
Service Industries	Paadi
If selling products does not appeal to you consider offering various services
Sɛ w’ani nnye adetɔn ho a susuw paa ahorow a wubetumi adi ho
Domestic work such as cleaning cooking and washing and ironing clothes is always in demand
Ofie nnwuma te sɛ afisiesie aduannoa ne ntadehoro ne ɛso tow yɛ nnwuma a wohia nnipa ma wɔayɛ bere nyinaa
And there are numerous other opportunities
Na nnwuma afoforo pii wɔ hɔ
For example do you live near the ocean or near a fish market ?	Sɛ nhwɛso no so wote bɛn ɛpo anaa gua a wɔtɔn nsunam wom ?
Why not offer to clean fish quickly and at low cost ?	Dɛn nti na wunkoyiyi nsunam ho adwuma a ne yɛ nnye bere na ɛmmɔ ka kɛse ?
All you need is a good block of wood and a fine fish knife
Nea wuhia ara ne duasin ne sekamma a ɛyɛ nnam a wɔde twitwa nsunam
Car washing is another profitable enterprise
Kar ho hohoro nso yɛ adwuma foforo a sika wom
Needed equipment ?	Nneɛma bɛn na wubehia ?
A bucket some water a little soap and a good cloth
Bokiti nsu samena kakra ne ntamasin a ɛyɛ papa
In Dakar business minded youths can be seen on almost all parking lots and on many a shaded street performing this service
Wɔ Dakar no ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wotumi hu mmofra a wɔpɛ adwuma sɛ wɔreyɛ saa adwuma yi wɔ mmeae a kar gyinagyina nyinaa ne akwan pii a onwini wɔ so so
Is running water scarce in your part of the world ?	So nsu a ɛtene ho yɛ na wɔ baabi a wote ?
Sometimes women line up for hours at a common water fountain to have their containers filled
Ɛtɔ da bi a mmea to santen nnɔnhwerew pii wɔ asubura bi ano kɔpɛ nsu gu wɔn nsuhina mu
Then they have to transport the heavy basins on their heads all the way home
Ɛno akyi no ɛsɛ sɛ wɔsoa wɔn hweaseammɔ a emu yɛ duru no twa kwan kɔ wɔn afie mu
Many are therefore willing to pay someone who will deliver the water to them
Enti wɔn mu pii wɔ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔbɛma obi sika ma ɔde nsu no abrɛ wɔn
The trick is getting to the water fountain early in the morning so that you can fill your containers and load them onto a hand pushed or donkey pulled cart
Nea eye ne sɛ wobɛkɔ asubura no ano anɔpatutu sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi ahyehyɛ wo nsuhina no amaama na wode asisi trɔk anaa teaseɛnam so
Now you are ready to deliver the water to homes or work sites
Afei woasiesie wo ho sɛ wode nsu no bɛkɔ afie anaa adwumayɛbea ahorow mu ara ne no
Do you have some secular schooling ?	Woakɔ sukuu kakra ?
Perhaps you could offer to tutor young children on weekends
Ebia wubetumi akyerɛ mmofra nkumaa ade dapɛn awiei
Classrooms tend to be crowded in developing lands and parents may be willing to pay for their child to receive some personal attention
Mmofra taa kyere so wɔ sukuu adan mu wɔ aman a wonnyaa nkɔso pii mu na ebia awofo bɛpɛ sɛ wɔbɛma obi sika de ama wɔn ba anya ɔhwɛ soronko
Another useful skill you may already have is the art of hair braiding
Adwuma foforo a mfaso wɔ so a ebia wunim dedaw ne mmɛsawɔw
Since braided hair styles are quite popular among women in Africa there is a market for people skilled at this craft
Esiane sɛ Afrikafo mmea ani gye mmɛsawɔw ho kɛse nti nkurɔfo a wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ saa adwinni yi mu no nya adwuma
Using Ingenuity	Nyansa a Wode Bedi Dwuma
In Bible times a capable wife could find clever ways to generate income
Wɔ Bible mmere mu no na ɔyere pa tumi fa nyansa kwan ahorow so nya sika
Says Proverbs She has made even undergarments and proceeded to sell them and belts she has given to the tradesmen
Mmebusɛm ka sɛ Ɔpam nkamisaa na ɔtɔn na ɔde abɔso ma oguadini
Similarly many in developing lands have found success in running their own cottage industries or small businesses
Saa pɛpɛɛpɛ na nnipa pii a wɔwɔ aman a ennyaa nkɔso pii mu adi yiye wɔ wɔn ankasa nnwuma a wɔyɛ anaa aguadi nketewa mu
A carpenter for example may set up a small shop and make simple stools benches and other household items
Sɛ nhwɛso no ebia duadwumfo bi bebue adwumayɛbea ketewaa bi na wayɛ nnwinnade a ne yɛ nyɛ den benkyi ne ofie nneɛma ahorow
Only the most basic carpentry tools are needed
Nea obehia ara ne nnwinnade a wɔde yɛ duadwumfo nnwuma nketenkete nkutoo
If you have some agricultural skills perhaps you could start a poultry business and sell eggs and chickens
Sɛ wowɔ mmoayɛn ho nimdeɛ bi a ebia wubetumi afi ase ayɛn bi na woatɔn nkesua ne nkokɔ
Ingenuity is an important requisite for starting small industries
Nyansa yɛ ade titiriw a ɛho hia wɔ nnwuma nketewa asefi mu
Some people have turned discarded tin containers into colorful suitcases and trunks
Nnipa binom de ntonturowa a wɔato agu ayeyɛ nnaka a wɔde nneɛma gu mu a ɛyɛ fɛ
Others have made sandals out of automobile tires
Afoforo de kar tae ayeyɛ mpaboa
Still others have constructed buckets out of old inner tubes
Afoforo nso de kar tae mu rɔba dedaw ayeyɛ bokiti
The possibilities may be limited only by your own imagination
Ebia w’ankasa wo nsusuwii na ɛbɛma ayɛ te sɛ nea wuntumi nyɛ nnwuma pii
In developing lands it takes both skill and imagination to survive but you also need patience and a positive attitude
Egye ahokokwaw ne adwene na obi atumi atra ase wɔ aman a ennyaa nkɔso pii no mu nanso wuhia boasetɔ ne adwempa nso
Do not give up easily
Mpa abaw ntɛm
Be flexible ready to change jobs if necessary
Yɛ fakaa na yɛ krado sɛ wobɛsakra w’adwuma sɛ ɛho hia sɛ woyɛ saa a
If starting a business or offering a service be sure to check into local laws and ordinances
Sɛ worefi adwuma anaa paadi bi ase a hwɛ hu sɛ woahwehwɛ ɛhɔ mmara ahorow mu yiye
Christians are required to respect the law of the land
Romans

Before attempting to offer a product or service ask yourself What are the local needs and customs ?	Ansa na wubefi ase ayɛ biribi anaasɛ wubedi paa bi no bisa wo ho sɛ Dɛn ne ɛha ahiade ne amanne ahorow
What is the condition of the local economy ?	Ɛha sikasɛm te dɛn ?
Can customers afford to pay for what I am offering ?	So nkurɔfo betumi atɔ nea meretɔn no ?
How many others are offering a similar product or service ?	Nnipa baahe na wɔretɔn ade koro no anaa wɔredi paa koro no ara ?
Do I really have the skills energy initiative self discipline and sense of organization needed to carry on this enterprise ?	So mewɔ ahokokwaw ahoɔden akokoduru a wɔde fi biribi ase ahohyɛso ne nhyehyɛe pa a ehia a mede bɛyɛ adwuma yi ?
How much of an investment will be involved ?	Sika dodow ahe na ebehia ?
Will I have to borrow ?	So ɛho behia sɛ mebɔ bosea ?
Will I be able to pay off the loan ? 	So metumi atua bosea no ? ’
Jesus question at Luke is apropos Who of you that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it ?

True not all have the skills or the temperament to be self employed
Ampa ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔwɔ ahokokwaw anaa koma a ɛbɛma ɔno ankasa atumi ayɛ n’adwuma
Yet Jehovah God can bless your initiative and earnest effort when it is put forward with a right motive

We do not know however the extent to which Jesus other followers served as missionaries in foreign lands
Nanso yennim faako a Yesu akyidifo afoforo no som kodui wɔ amannɔne nsase so sɛ asɛmpatrɛwfo
Traditional beliefs that Thomas went to India and Mark the evangelist went to Egypt cannot be confirmed
Wontumi nkyerɛ sɛ atetesɛm a ɛne sɛ Toma kɔɔ India na ɔsɛmpakafo Marko kɔɔ Misraim no yɛ nokware
What we do know is that all of Christ s true disciples had the missionary spirit and that they all did missionary work at least in their homeland

The Jews believed in the worship of one true God
Na Yudafo no gye di sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔsom nokware Nyankopɔn koro pɛ
They set their hopes on a promised Messiah
Wɔde wɔn ani too Mesia bi a na wɔahyɛ ne ho bɔ so
They accepted the Hebrew Scriptures as God s Word of truth
Wogyee Hebri Kyerɛwnsɛm no toom sɛ Onyankopɔn Asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware
Hence citizens of the countries into which the Jews had been scattered were likely somewhat familiar with these beliefs
Enti ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na aman a Yudafo no hwete kɔɔ mu no mufo nim gyidi horow yi wɔ ɔkwan bi so
Since these were aspects of worship that Christians and Jews had in common the message of Christianity when it appeared was not totally new
Esiane sɛ na eyi ne ɔsom afa horow a Kristofo ne Yudafo nyinaa gye tom nti bere a Kristosom ho asɛm daa adi no na ɛnyɛ foforo koraa
According to Kane these factors were of immense help to the Christian missionaries as they traveled throughout the Roman world preaching the gospel and planting churches
Sɛnea Kane kyerɛ no nneɛma yi boaa Kristofo asɛmpatrɛwfo no kɛse bere a wokyinkyinii Roma ahemman no mu nyinaa kaa asɛmpa no hyehyɛɛ asɔre ahorow no
The Jewish dispersal thus prepared the way for Christianity

The rapid spread of Christianity took place because Christians had the missionary spirit

In the early eighth century Boniface an English Benedictine monk turned his attention to Germany
Wɔ afeha a ɛto so awotwe mfiase mu hɔ no Boniface Engiresini Benedict kokorani bi de n’adwene sii Germany so
Kane says Boniface s brilliant missionary career stretching over forty years earned for him the title of the Apostle to Germany and helped make him the greatest missionary of the Dark Ages

When Boniface was over he and some companions were killed by Frisian non believers

The Encyclopedia of Religion describes a method Boniface successfully used to make converts to Catholicism At Geismar near Gottingen Germany he dared to fell the sacred oak of Thor

When he suffered no vengeance from the resident Germanic god it was clear that the God whom he preached was the true God who alone is to be worshipped and adored

Some missionaries used other methods evidently thinking the end justifies the means
Asɛmpatrɛwfo bi faa akwan afoforo so na adanse a ɛwɔ hɔ kyerɛ sɛ wosusuwii sɛ ɔkwan biara a wɔbɛfa so adu wɔn botae ho no ye
Kane admits that the conversion of the Germanic Saxons was effected by military conquest rather than moral or religious persuasion
Kane gye tom sɛ wɔnam asraafo nkonimdi so na ɛsakraa Germany Saxonfo no na ɛnyɛ abrabɔ anaa nyamesom nkyerɛkyerɛ so
He adds The unholy alliance between the church and the state
prompted the church to employ carnal means to achieve spiritual ends
Ɔde ka ho sɛ Asɔre no ne ɔman no ntam ayɔnkofa a ɛho ntew

Nowhere was this policy more disastrous than in the work of Christian missions especially among the Saxons

Separate missionary campaigns were conducted by the two branches of professed Christianity practiced in Rome and Constantinople

Their attempts to Christianize Bulgaria led to confusion typical of a religiously divided house

Bulgaria s ruler Boris I converted to Greek Orthodoxy

Upon seeing however that Constantinople severely curtailed the independence of the Bulgarian church he turned to the West permitting German missionaries representing Rome to bring their version of Christianity

Meanwhile both strands of Christianity were finding support in Poland

During the ninth century two brothers from a prominent Greek family in Thessalonica brought Byzantine Christianity to Slavic sections of Europe and Asia

Cyril also called Constantine and Methodius became known as the apostles to the Slavs
Wɔbɛfrɛɛ Cyril a wɔsan frɛ no Constantine ne Methodius sɛ asomafo ma Slavfo
One of Cyril s accomplishments was his development of a written language for the Slavs
Nneɛma a Cyril yɛe no biako ne sɛ ɔmaa Slavfo nyaa kasa a wɔkyerɛw
Its alphabet based on Hebrew and Greek letters is known as the Cyrillic alphabet and is still used in such languages as Russian Ukrainian Bulgarian and Serbian

These two brothers translated parts of the Bible into the new written language and also introduced the liturgy in Slavic
Anuanom baanu yi kyerɛɛ Bible no afa horow ase kɔɔ kasa foforo a wɔkyerɛw no mu na afei nso wɔde Slavfo kasa kyerɛw asɔre no gyidi
This was contrary to the policy of the Western church which wanted to keep the liturgy in Latin Greek and Hebrew
Na eyi ne Atɔe Fam asɔre no a na ɛpɛ sɛ asɔre no gyidi tra Latin Hela ne Hebri kasa mu no nhyehyɛe bɔ abira
Author Kane says The use of the vernacular in worship a practice encouraged by Constantinople but condemned by Rome was a new departure and established a precedent which came to full bloom in the modern missionary enterprise of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries

It is said he chose the Byzantine form of Christian religion over Judaism and Islam because of its impressive ritual not because of any message of hope and truth
Wose ɔpaw Byzantium Kristosom no pow Yudasom ne Nkramosom esiane n’amanne akɛse no nti na ɛnyɛ anidaso ne nokware ho asɛm bi a ɛka
In fact the timing of Vladimir s conversion says Keeping the Faiths Religion and Ideology in the Soviet Union suggests that he adopted the new religion to serve his political interests thus beginning a tradition that has run virtually unbroken throughout the history of the Russian Orthodox Church

The book then adds this sobering thought The church has generally been willing to serve the interests of the government even when the government has infringed upon the interests of the church

Once he adopted Orthodoxy as the state religion says Paul Steeves he embarked on a program of uprooting the traditional religious practices of indigenous Slavic tribes
Paul Steeves ka sɛ bere a wonya gyee Ortodoks som toom sɛ ɔman no som no ofii dwumadi bi ase de guu Slavfo mmusuakuw tete nyamesom nneyɛe no ase
On sites where people had formerly sacrificed to pagan idols for example he built churches
Sɛ nhwɛso no osisii asɔre adan wɔ mmeae a kan na nnipa no bɔ afɔre ma abosom no
Steeves adds Remnants of paganism nonetheless survived for several centuries and were finally not so much eliminated as assimilated into Russian religious life

The th century Reformation set spiritual fires aglow throughout Europe

Today it can be seen that Christendom s missionaries sadly failed to instill within their European converts a Christian faith and hope strong enough to stem the rise in our th century of atheistic Communism and other totalitarian ideologies

Furthermore the relationship between teacher and class is strengthened

Christians know that God condemns smoking taking drugs misusing alcohol or indulging in premarital sex
Kristofo nim sɛ Onyankopɔn kasa tia tawanom nnubɔnenom asabow anaa ho a wɔde hyɛ nna a edi aware anim mu
That s why association with youths who practice such things is wisely avoided
Ɛno nti wofi nyansa mu kwati fekuw a wɔne mmofra a wɔyɛ saa nneɛma no bɛbɔ no
Proverbs warns He that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly
Mmebusɛm bɔ kɔkɔ sɛ Nea ɔne nkwasea bɔ no hu amane
On a class trip you spend more time than usual with such youths and this in a relaxed atmosphere
Wo ne mmofra a wɔte sɛɛ bɔ kyɛ wɔ kwan a sukuufo tu kɔhwehwɛ mmeaemmeae no mu sen sɛnea moyɛ daa no na moyɛ eyi bere a moregye mo ahome
Young Andreas put it this way On a class trip you are exposed around the clock to the spirit of the world with all the worldly music and obscene talk
Abofra Andreas ka ho asɛm wɔ saa kwan yi so sɛ Sɛ wo ne sukuufo tu kwan kɔhwehwɛ mmeaemmeae a wuhu wiase no honhom ne ne nnwom ne kasafi awia ne anadwo
Another factor is that it s easy to feel lonely when you are away from home
Ade foforo ne sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛte nka sɛ woyɛ ankonam bere a woatu kwan no
Class trips have sparked many a teenage romance
Ɔkwan a sukuufo tu no ama mmofra pii de wɔn ho ahyɛ ɔbarima ne ɔbea ntam ayɔnkofa a ɛkɔ akyiri mu
Would there be a risk of your becoming romantically involved with an unbeliever ?	So ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom sɛ wobɛkyerɛ obi a ɔnyɛ gyidini ho anigye ?
First Corinthians warns Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall
Korintofo Nhoma a Edi Kan bɔ kɔkɔ sɛ Nea ɛyɛ no sɛ ogyina hɔ nhwɛ yiye na wanhwe ase
And even if you were strong enough to resist temptation could your presence on such a trip be a stumbling block to other Christian youths ? Compare Corinthians
Na sɛ woyɛ den kɛse a wubetumi ako atia sɔhwɛ mpo a so ɔkwan a ɛte sɛɛ a wubetu bi no bɛto Kristofo mmofra afoforo hintidua ? Fa toto Korintofo ho
Fourteen year old Yvonne turned down going on a class ski trip
Yvonne a wadi mfe dunnan no ampene so sɛ ɔne ne sukuufo bɛkɔ akotu mmirika wɔ sukyerɛmma so
She explains I would have spent a whole week with no one but worldly youths and teachers
Ɔkyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Anka wiasefo mmofra ne akyerɛkyerɛfo nkutoo na me ne wɔn bɛbɔ dapɛn mu no nyinaa
On top of that the companionship of my brothers the preaching work and the meetings those are things I would really have missed
Bio nso me nuanom fekubɔ asɛnka adwuma ne nhyiam horow eyinom ne nneɛma a anka ɛbɛpa me ti so ankasa
Another reason was the way most youths behave when no one keeps an eye on them
Ade foforo nti a mankɔ ne sɛnea mmofra dodow no ara bɔ wɔn bra bere a obiara nhwɛ wɔn so no
Fully Pleasing God	Onyankopɔn a Wobɛsɔ N’ani Koraa
Since class trips normally do not directly involve religion politics or other activities that are forbidden to Christians a student and his parents will have to decide whether such a trip is advisable
Esiane sɛ akwan a sukuufo tu kɔhwehwɛ mmeaemmeae ntaa mfa nyamesom amammuisɛm anaa dwumadi afoforo a Kristofo mmfa wɔn ho nhyem ho tee nti ɛsɛ sɛ sukuuni ne n’awofo na wosi gyinae sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ otu kwan a ɛte sɛɛ anaa
Compare Isaiah Revelation
Fa toto Yesaia Adiyisɛm ho
Conditions and circumstances vary from place to place and from one class to another therefore Christians in one area may have to contend with problems different from those in another
Nsɛm tebea gu ahorow wɔ mmeaemmeae ne adesuakuw ahorow mu enti ebia Kristofo a wɔwɔ beae bi behyia ɔhaw ahorow a ɛyɛ soronko wɔ baabi foforo
My mother was familiar with the youths in my class and knew the teacher to be responsible minded
Stephan ka sɛ Na me maame nim m’adesuakuw mu mmofra ne sɛ ɔkyerɛkyerɛfo no ntoto n’asɛyɛde ase
So the class trip was a success remarks Stephan
Enti sukuufo akwantu no kɔɔ so dwoodwoo
But when I got older and the final trip approached the question of my going along was completely different
Nanso bere a minyinii na akwantu a etwa to no bɛnee no na kɔ a me ne wɔn bɛkɔ no yɛ asɛm foforo koraa
Why ?	Dɛn ntia ?
He continues Just three years earlier my classmates had been pleasant and respectable
Ɔtoa so sɛ Mfe abiɛsa pɛ a etwaam no na me mfɛfo sukuufo abrabɔ ye na wɔda obu adi
But drugs and immorality had since become part of their everyday life
Nanso na ɔbrasɛe ne nnuru a wɔde di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so abɛyɛ wɔn daa asetram adeyɛ fi saa bere no
So I didn t join the trip
Enti mantu kwan no bi
Incidentally the final trip had to be terminated before it was finished
Nea ɛbae ne sɛ wotwaa akwantu no so
In the final analysis though you and your parents must weigh all the factors involved and make your own decision
Nanso awiei koraa ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne w’awofo susuw nea mobɛyɛ nyinaa ho ansa na w’ankasa woasi gyinae
Make sure that whatever you decide your goal is to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him

Bamboo Organ Philippine Musical Novelty	Mpampuro Adakabɛn Philippine Nnwonto mu Anwonwade
BY AWAKE !	EFI NYAN !
CORRESPONDENT IN THE PHILIPPINES	KYERƐWFO A ƆWƆ PHILIPPINES HƆ
ORGANS have existed in one form or another for over years
NNAKABƐN ahorow ahorow na aba wɔ bɛboro mfe a atwam no mu
Techniques for building them have varied but common to all organs are the rows of pipes that are part of the sound producing mechanism
Akwan a wɔfa so yɛ no gu ahorow nanso nnakabɛn nyinaa wɔ adorobɛn a ɛsesa so a ɛboa ma etumi gyigye
These are generally made of wood and metal
Wɔtaa de nnua ne nnade na ɛyɛ eyinom
The organ we wish to tell you about however has pipes primarily made of bamboo
Nanso adakabɛn a yɛpɛ sɛ yɛka ho asɛm kyerɛ wo no wɔ adorobɛn a wɔde mpampuro titiriw na ayɛ
A total of of its sound producing pipes are bamboo
N’adorobɛn a ɛma nnyigyei no mu yɛ mpampuro
The others are metal
Nea aka no yɛ nnade
In addition there are some pipes that are only decorative
Bio nso ɛwɔ adorobɛn bi a wɔde asiesie ho kɛkɛ
How does the bamboo organ work ?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na mpampuro adakabɛn yɛ adwuma ?
The principle is the same as for other pipe organs
Ɛyɛ adwuma te sɛ nnakabɛn afoforo a ɛwɔ adorobɛn no ara pɛ
Two types of pipes are used and wind is pumped into them to produce musical sounds
Adorobɛn abien na wɔde di dwuma na wohuw mframa gu mu ma egyigye
Flue pipes with half circle holes close to their points of connection with the console produce sound in much the same manner as a flute
Mframa adorobɛn a ɛwowɔ ntokuru a ɛreyɛ ayɛ nkuruwankuruwa a ɛbemmɛn faako a wɔde asoso adakabɛn no ankasa mu no ma nnigyei sɛnea atɛntɛbɛn yɛ no ara pɛ
Reed pipes with a vibrating element inside produce sound in a manner similar to a clarinet or a saxophone
Demmire adorobɛn a nnade a ɛwosowosow hyehyem ma nnyigyei sɛnea clarinet anaa saxophone yɛ no ara pɛ
The fact that most pipes are made of bamboo gives this organ special acoustical characteristics
Mpampuro a wɔde ayɛ adorobɛn no dodow no ara no ma adakabɛn yi nnyigyei yɛ soronko
Building the Organ	Adakabɛn no Yɛ
Construction of this bamboo organ was begun in by a Spanish missionary Diego Cera
Spainni ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo bi Diego Cera na ofii ase yɛɛ mpampuro adakabɛn yi wɔ mu
Why was bamboo used ?	Dɛn nti na ɔde mpampuro yɛe ?
Considering the relative poverty of the area perhaps the need to use inexpensive materials was a factor
Ebia ohia kakra a ɛwɔ saa ɔman no mu nti na ɛho hia sɛ ɔde nneɛma a ne bo nyɛ den di dwuma
Moreover the maker of the organ no doubt desired to use appropriate local materials
Afei nso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nea ɔyɛɛ adakabɛn no pɛe sɛ ɔde ɛhɔnom nneɛma a ɛfata na ɛyɛ
In bamboos were cut and buried under the sand of the seashore for about a year
Wɔ mu no otwitwaa mpampuro de siee mpoano anhwea mu maa no dii bɛyɛ afe
Those that survived this exposure to insects and the elements were considered of durable quality and used in building the organ
Obuu nea nkoekoemmoa ne wim tebea yi antumi ansɛe no no sɛ ɛno na ɛbɛkyɛ na ɔde yɛɛ adakabɛn no
Over the next several years the various parts of the organ were put together
Mfe pii a edi hɔ no ɔkekaa adakabɛn no afa horow no boboom
When the bulk of it was finished in it was proclaimed the finest and the first of its kind in the country
Bere a owiee ne nyinaa wɔ mu no wɔkaa ho asɛm sɛ nea ɛsen biara ne nea wonnyaa ɛso bi da wɔ ɔman no mu
Surviving Adversity	Tebea Bɔne Ano a Agyina
Life for the bamboo organ has not been easy
Tebea no nkɔɔ yiye mmaa mpampuro adakabɛn no
The year saw earthquakes in the town of Las Pinas where the organ is located
Asasewosow sisii wɔ afe mu wɔ Las Pinas kurow a adakabɛn no wɔ no mu
The roof of the building that housed it was destroyed and likely the organ was exposed to the elements for a while
Ɔdan a na esi mu no so pae na ebia wim tebea no kaa adakabɛn no kakra
In an exceptionally strong earthquake caused more damage to the organ
Wɔ mu no asasewosow bi a ano yɛ den mmoroso sɛee adakabɛn no kɛse mpo
Some pipes were replaced but insects ravaged these over a period of time
Wɔsesaa adorobɛn no bi nanso nkoekoemmoa tow hyɛɛ so bere tenten bi
In another catastrophic earthquake badly damaged the building housing the organ and a typhoon struck before the building was completely repaired
Wɔ mu no asasewosow a ano yɛ den foforo sɛee ɔdan a adakabɛn no si mu no kɛse na bere a wonnya nsiesiee dan no nwiei no ahum kɛse bi tui
By then various pieces of the organ were scattered about
Eduu saa bere no na adakabɛn no afa horow bi abɔ apete
Some repairs were attempted over the years but one such attempt resulted in permanent damage
Wɔde mfe pii bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wobesiesie nanso bere a wɔbɔɔ mmɔden bi sɛ wɔbɛyɛ no ɛsɛee no maa anyɛ sɛnea na ɛte bio
A repairman sawed off portions of the bamboo pipes in order to apply some tuning valves
Obi a na ɔresiesie twitwaa mpampuro adorobɛn no afa bi de mmuaso hyehyeem
This permanently changed the instrument s pitch
Eyi sakraa sɛnea adakabɛn no gyigye no kɛse
And despite the repair efforts the organ continued to deteriorate
Na ɛmfa ho mmɔden a wɔbɔe sɛ wobesiesie adakabɛn no ɛkɔɔ so sɛee
The organ also endured war
Adakabɛn no faa akodi mu nso
Las Pinas was the scene of skirmishes between Filipinos and Spaniards during the late s and between Filipinos and Americans during the Philippine American War
Las Pinas na Philippinesfo ne Spainfo dii ako wɔ mfe no mu na Philippinesfo ne Amerikafo ko no nso sii wɔ hɔ
Nevertheless despite its deterioration records from to indicate that visitors came to see the organ
Nanso ɛmfa ho sɛ adakabɛn no sɛee no kyerɛwtohɔ a wɔyɛe fi kosi no kyerɛ sɛ ahɔho bɛhwɛe
The years to brought the second world war to the Philippines
Afe kosi mu na wiase nyinaa ko a ɛto so abien no baa Philippines
During the Japanese occupation the organ received attention from the Marquess Y
Bere a Japanfo dɔm baa hɔ no Onuonyamfo Y
Tokugawa a relative of Emperor Hirohito
Tokugawa a ɔyɛ Ɔhempɔn Hirohito busuani de n’adwene kɔɔ adakabɛn no so
He arranged for partial repairs but after that very little was done to the instrument for many years
Ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe ma wosiesiei kakra nanso ɛno akyi no wɔanyɛ adakabɛn no ho biribi titiriw biara mfe pii
Then in the s a clamor arose for its restoration
Afei wɔ mfe no mu no nkurɔfo kaa ho asɛm denneennen sɛ wɔnsan nsiesie
Of the hundreds of bamboo pipes were missing and were not working
Na mpampuro adorobɛn ɔhaha pii no mu ayerayera na nyɛ adwuma
A bird s nest was found inside one
Wohuu anomaa berebuw wɔ biako mu
Could anything be done to get the organ back to performance standard ?	So na biribi wɔ hɔ a wobetumi ayɛ ama adakabɛn no atumi ayɛ adwuma bio ?
Restoration	Ne Siesie
The restoration project was started in March a reputable foreign firm being entrusted with the work
Wofii ase siesiei wɔ March mu na amannɔne adwuma bi na wɔde ho adwuma no hyɛɛ wɔn nsa
The pipes were shipped to Japan and the rest of the organ was shipped to Germany
Wɔde adorobɛn no faa po so hyɛn kɔɔ Japan na wɔde adakabɛn no nkae guu hyɛn mu kɔɔ Germany
There a special room was built to simulate the climate of the Philippines
Ɛhɔ na wosii ɔdan soronko bi yɛɛ emu tebea te sɛ Philippines wim tebea no ara pɛ
In this room the restoration work proceeded
Ne siesie no kɔɔ so wɔ saa dan yi mu
The goal was to keep things as close as possible to the original design
Na botae no ne sɛ wɔbɛyɛ ma asɛ mfiase de no sɛnea ebetumi biara
Finally the repairs were finished
Awiei koraa no wosiesie wiei
Pipes repaired in Japan were flown to Germany
Wɔde adorobɛn a wɔasiesie wɔ Japan no faa wimhyɛn baa Germany
The complete organ was reassembled and tested
Wɔhyehyɛɛ adakabɛn mu no bio na wɔsɔ hwɛe
Then on February it delighted the ears of a German audience in a one hour concert
Afei wɔ February no wɔde dii agoru dɔnhwerew biako kyerɛɛ Germanfo bi ma ɛyɛɛ wɔn dɛ
Soon afterward the organ was packed into a dozen crates and all pounds kg of it was shipped back to the Philippines through the courtesy of a Belgian airline
Ɛno akyi pɛɛ no wɔhyehyɛɛ adakabɛn no guu nnaka dummien mu na ɛdenam Belguim wimhyɛn dwumadi bi mmoa so no wɔde ne nyinaa a emu duru yɛ kilogram san kɔɔ Philippines
It received a grand welcome in Las Pinas the town where it would be housed
Wɔde anigye hyiaa no kwan wɔ Las Pinas kurow a na wɔbɛkora so wom no
Thirty thousand watched a parade complete with floats depicting episodes from the history of the instrument
Nnipa mpem aduasa na wɔhwɛɛ nneɛma a wɔde sisii lɔre ahorow mu de yɛɛ adakabɛn no abakɔsɛm ho ɔyɛkyerɛ no
By May the bamboo organ was ready for its inaugural concert
Eduu May no na wɔawie mpampuro adakabɛn no a wobetumi de adi agoru de afi ne dwumadi ase
A German organist was featured along with Filipino musicians as the bamboo organ was reintroduced to the Philippines
Germanni sankubɔfo bi ne Philippinesfo nnwontofo bi bedii agoru maa wɔde yii mpampuro adakabɛn no adi bio wɔ Philippines
Do you appreciate the gift of music that our Creator gave us ?	So w’ani sɔ nnwom akyɛde a yɛn Bɔfo no de ama yɛn no ?
Would you like to hear something a little different ?	Wobɛpɛ sɛ wote biribi a ɛyɛ soronko kakra ?

School Tyranny	Sukuu mu Nhyɛso Ntraso
A boy who was expelled from Kobe Municipal Technical Junior College in Japan is petitioning for his right to be educated
Abarimaa bi a wɔpam no fii Kobe Mpɔtam Mmofra Tɛknikal Kɔlege a ɛwɔ Japan mu no de hokwan a ɔwɔ sɛ ɔkɔ sukuu ho adesrɛ ato gua
Because of his religious conscience as one of Jehovah s Witnesses he did not participate in kendo Japanese fencing drills taught as part of physical education

It goes against all common sense in school said Professor Tetsuo Shimomura of Tsukuba University in the Yomiuri Shimbun to disciplinarily expel a student for poor schoolwork who has no other problem just because he does not measure up to the passing score by a few points in one specific subject

Catholic Church to Repent ?	So Ɛsɛ sɛ Katolek Asɔre no Da Ahonu Adi ?
In a letter sent to Catholic cardinals Pope John Paul II has exhorted the church to recognize the errors committed by its men in its name and to repent of them

Exodus to Alternative Religion	Wogyae Asɔre no Kɔ Foforo
The Church of England is experiencing a mass exodus of clergymen

 The apparent trigger has been the Church of England s controversial decision to ordain female priests reports The Toronto Star
The Toronto Star ka sɛ Nea ɛda adi sɛ ama aba saa ne gyinae a asɛm wɔ ho a England Asɔre no sii sɛ wɔnhyɛ mmea asɔfo no

Staggering Cost of Crime	Ɛka Kɛse a Wɔbɔ wɔ Nsɛmmɔnedi Ho
A recent report by the Australian Institute of Criminology revealed that the cost of crime in Australia amounts to billion each year

This represents almost for every man woman and child in Australia
Eyi kyerɛ sɛ ɔbarima ɔbea ne abofra biara a ɔwɔ Australia no tua
A spokesman quoted in the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph said that the most costly form of crime is fraud accounting possibly for almost billion a year

More Watching Less Reading	Wɔhwɛ Pii Wɔnkenkan Ade Pii
Why do schoolchildren who watch a lot of television lose interest in reading ?	Dɛn nti na sukuufo mmofra a wɔhwɛ television pii nkyerɛ akenkan ho anigye bio no ?

Finally you state that New Age beliefs can only bring more darkness

A Warm Water Seal ?	So Sukraman A Ɔtra Nsu A Ɛnyɛ Nwini Mu Wɔ Hɔ ?
SEALS are often depicted in the icy white expanses of Arctic or Antarctic waters

But did you know that some seals can thrive in a temperate climate basking on the sand of deserted beaches ?	Nanso na wunim sɛ asukraman binom tumi tra baabi a ɛhɔ nyɛ nwini pii a wɔto awia wɔ anhwea a ɛwɔ mpoano a obiara nte hɔ bio so ma ɛyɛ yiye ?
Meet the Mediterranean monk seal
Momma yɛnhwɛ Mediteranea Po mu sukraman kokorani no
Measuring up to feet
m in length this warm water seal has short thick hair covered with dark patches with a whitish belly and breast
Sukraman yi a otumi tra nsu a ɛnyɛ nwini mu a ne tenten tumi du mita
no ho nhwi yɛ ntiantia pipiripii a emu asisi tuntum na ne yafunu ne ne koko so nhwi yɛ fitaa
These distinctive colors similar to the habit of some religious orders may explain its name
Ebia saa kɔla soronko yi a ɛte sɛ nyamesomfo bi ntade a wɔhyɛ no bɛma yeate ne din no ase
Several Bible passages mention a skin called ta chash in Hebrew which covered the tabernacle and utensils in the sanctuary
Bible afa pii ka aboa nhoma bi a wɔfrɛ no ta chash wɔ Hebri kasa mu a na ɛkata ahyiae ntamadan no ne kronkronbea no mu anwinne so no ho asɛm
Some experts suggest that ta chash refers to sealskin
Animdefo bi susuw sɛ ta chash yɛ sukraman nhoma
Could it be the skin of the Mediterranean monk seal ?	So ebetumi aba sɛ ɛyɛ Mediteranea Po mu sukraman kokorani no nhoma ?
The presence of this animal in ancient Mediterranean waters makes this supposition valid
Saa aboa yi a ɔwɔ tete Mediteranea Po mu no ma osusuka yi fata
Ancient folklore attributed special powers to the monk seal
Atetesɛm kyerɛ sɛ sukraman kokorani no wɔ tumi soronko bi
Its skin some believed could ward off bolts of lightning and prevent hail from falling on cultivated fields
Ebinom gye di sɛ ne nhoma no tumi ma ɔsraman man fa nkyɛn na ɛmma asukɔtweaa ntɔ ngu mfuw so
By either standing on end or lying flat the hairs of the sealskin were said to indicate the onset or imminent conclusion of a thunderstorm
Wɔkyerɛ sɛ wɔnam sukraman ho nhwi a ɛsɔresɔre gyina anaasɛ ɛdeda no so tumi kyerɛ sɛ ahum bi rebetu anaasɛ ɛrebegyae
Because of its supposed powers the monk seal was almost driven to extinction by merciless hunters
Esiane sɛ na wosusuw sɛ sukraman kokorani no wɔ tumi nti anka abɔmmɔfo atirimɔdenfo reyɛ atɔre n’ase
Recently however it has been sighted in the sea around east central Sardinia
Nanso nnansa yi wɔahu no wɔ ɛpo a ɛbɛn Sardinia apuei fam mfinimfini no mu
When harmony between man and animal is reestablished in God s new world the Mediterranean monk seal will undoubtedly repossess tranquil and peaceful beaches where it will be able to bask in the sun unthreatened by greedy humans
Isaiah

Long standing grudges and suspicious attitudes have grown into hate

This hate has led to fighting and the fighting to more killing and more destruction

History tells us that at the time of the assassination of Francis Ferdinand in the South Slavic countries of Slovenia Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were provinces in the Austro Hungarian Empire
Abakɔsɛm kyerɛ yɛn sɛ bere a wokum Francis Ferdinand wɔ mu no na Slavfo Kesee Fam aman a ɛne Slovenia Croatia ne Bosnia ne Herzegovina yɛ Austro Hungary Ahemman no mu amantam
Serbia on the other hand was an independent kingdom and had been so since powerfully supported by Russia
Nanso na Serbia yɛ ahemman a ɛde ne ho na na ɛte saa fi a na Russia gyina n’akyi denneennen
Many Serbs however lived in the provinces dominated by Austria Hungary and Serbia therefore wanted Austria Hungary to give up all occupied areas on the Balkan Peninsula
Nanso na Serbiafo pii te amantam a ɛhyɛ Austria Hungary ase mu ma enti na Serbia pɛ sɛ Austria Hungary yi wɔn nsa fi Balkan Supɔw no afa horow a wodi so no nyinaa so
Even though conflicts existed between Croatia and Serbia they were united in one wish to rid themselves of the detested foreign masters

Nationalists dreamed of uniting all South Slavs into one kingdom

The Serbs were the strongest driving force in the formation of such an independent state

At that time the reigning emperor Francis Joseph was years old
Saa bere no na ɔhempɔn a ɔredi tumi Francis Joseph adi mfe
Soon Archduke Francis Ferdinand was to become the new emperor
Na ɛnkyɛ na Ɔheneba Francis Ferdinand abɛyɛ ɔhempɔn foforo no
The Serbian nationalists saw Francis Ferdinand as an obstacle to their realizing the dream of a South Slavic kingdom
Serbiafo amampɛfo no buu Francis Ferdinand sɛ osiw wɔn kwan wɔ Kesee Fam Slavfo ahemman a wobenya no ho
Some young students in Serbia were obsessed with the idea of a free South Slavic state and were willing to die for their cause

Several youths were chosen to carry out an assassination of the Archduke
Wɔpaw mmofra pii sɛ wonkokum Ɔheneba no
They were given weapons and trained by a secret Serbian nationalist group called the Black Hand
Esum ase Serbiafo ɔmampɛ kuw bi a wɔfrɛ wɔn Black Hand maa wɔn akode tetee wɔn
Two of these youths made an assassination attempt and one of them succeeded

This assassination served the intended purpose of the perpetrators
Saa awudi yi dii wɔn a wɔyɛɛ ho nhyehyɛe no atirimpɔw ho dwuma
When the first world war was over the monarchy of Austria Hungary had been dissolved and Serbia could take the lead in uniting the Slavs to form a kingdom
Bere a wiase ko a edi kan no baa awiei no na Austria Hungary ahemman no agu na na Serbia betumi adi anim aka Slavfo abom ahyehyɛ ahemman
In that kingdom came to be known as the Kingdom of the Serbs Croats and Slovenes

However when the different groups no longer needed to unite in their common enmity toward Austria Hungary it became evident that there were differences among the groups themselves

Yugoslavia and World War II	Yugoslavia ne Wiase Ko II
During World War II Germany invaded Yugoslavia and according to the book The Yugoslav Auschwitz and the Vatican more than people mostly Orthodox Serbs were systematically murdered by Catholic Croatians who were cooperating with the Nazis
Wɔ Wiase Ko II mu no Germany tuu Yugoslavia so sa na sɛnea nhoma The Yugoslav Auschwitz and the Vatican kyerɛ no Croatia Katolekfo a na wɔne Nasifo no ayɛ biako no kunkum nnipa bɛboro a na wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ Serbia Ortodokfo toatoaa so
However Croatian Josip Tito together with his Communist partisans and in cooperation with the British and the Americans was able to drive back the Germans
Nanso Croatiani Josip Tito ne ne Komunistfo akyidifo ne Britaniafo ne Amerikafo ka boom tumi pamoo Germanfo fii hɔ
When the war was over he stood out as the obvious leader of the country and proceeded to govern it with an iron hand
Bere a ɔko no baa awiei no ɛbɛdaa adi pefee sɛ ɔno na ɔbɛyɛ ɔman no kannifo na odii wɔn so atirimɔden so
He was an independent man

Not even Stalin could coerce him into bringing Yugoslavia into line with the rest of the Communist bloc
Stalin mpo antumi anhyɛ no sɛ ɔmma Yugoslavia ne Komunist aman a aka no nyɛ ade mmom
Many from the former Yugoslavia have said If it hadn t been for Tito the union would have fallen apart much earlier
Nnipa pii a wofi kan Yugoslavia aka sɛ Sɛ ɛnyɛ Tito a anka nkabom no gui ntɛm ara
He alone had the willpower and the necessary authority to hold it together

Attempts at Explaining 	Mmɔden a Wɔbɔ sɛ Wɔbɛkyerɛkyerɛ Mu
In his book Thunder at Twilight Vienna the author endeavors to explain what happened by pointing to what he calls the new power that influenced the nations in

This power he says was really several factors all working together
Ɔka sɛ na tumi yi yɛ nneɛma pii a ne nyinaa reyɛ adwuma bom ankasa
The few sober minded voices that were raised were drowned in the constantly growing cry for war

Authority was transferred from the ruling class to the generals

Many people also saw in the war a welcome opportunity to experience a grand national adventure and thereby get away from the dreariness of everyday life

Green twigs were fastened to their caps roses were hung in garlands around the canons orchestras played housewives waved with handkerchiefs from their windows and joyful children ran alongside the soldiers

It was as if people were celebrating and cheering the arrival of the war

World war came disguised as a festival

Civilization on Trial a Arnold Toynbee kyerɛwee
Like a ghost that lingered past the appointed hour the nineteenth century with its essential orderliness its self confidence and its faith in human progress had tarried until August when the major European powers suffered a collective attack of muddleheadedness that led directly to the senseless slaughter of millions of the best young men of a generation

Four and a half years later as the world tried to pick up the pieces after the wrenching cataclysm of the Great War it became apparent to many but by no means all contemporary observers that the last remaining vestiges of the old order had been swept away and that mankind had entered a new age that was considerably less rational and less forgiving of human imperfections

According to The Cambridge History of China some of the translation work that missionaries did was better suited to furthering European understanding of China than to building up Chinese receptivity to Christianity

Christendom s missionaries also failed to give the Chinese an example of Christian unity and brotherhood

But another factor not to be overlooked says one writer is that the missionaries allowed the converts to retain many of their religious beliefs and practices

Godly Sadness	Onyankopɔn Kwan so Awerɛhow
Not surprisingly then the Bible speaks of a sin that does incur death

Such a sin is not merely a weakness of the flesh
Bɔne a ɛte sɛɛ nyɛ ɔhonam mu mmerɛwyɛ ara kwa
It is committed deliberately obstinately stubbornly
Wɔboapa de asoɔden ne mpi na ɛyɛ
It is not so much the sin itself as it is the heart condition of the sinner that makes such a sin unforgivable
Ɛnyɛ bɔne no ankasa titiriw na ɛma ɛyɛ bɔne a wɔmfa mfiri na mmom ɔbɔnefo no komam tebea
The fact that you feel hurt and distressed over your misconduct however indicates that you have not committed an unforgivable sin

Nokwarem no hyɛ afotu a wɔde ma wɔ Yakobo no nsow Monhohoro mo nsa mo nnebɔneyɛfo na montew mo komam mo a mo kra yɛ ntanta
Give way to misery and mourn and weep
Munni nkɔmmɔ na mo werɛ nhow na munsu !
Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection
Mo serew nnan awerɛhow na mo anigye nnan anito !
Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah and he will exalt you
Mommrɛ mo ho ase Yehowa anim na ɔbɛma mo so
True the wrong may be a very serious one
Ɛwom ebia bɔne no bɛyɛ nea anibere wom kɛse
Young Julie for example got involved in necking and petting with a boyfriend
Sɛ nhwɛso no na abeawa Julie ne n’adamfo abarimaa bi sosɔ wɔn ho mu fefew wɔn ano
I felt very guilty at first she confesses but as time went on I got used to it
Ɔka sɛ Metee afodi nka mfiase no nanso bere kɔɔ so no anhaw me bio
It didn t bother my conscience so much
Anhaw m’ahonim ahe biara
In time unclean acts escalated to the point of sexual intercourse
Bere kɔɔ so no nneyɛe a ɛho ntew no nyaa nkɔanim ma ekowiee ɔbea ne ɔbarima nna mu
I felt miserable says Julie
Julie se Metee awerɛhow nka
My conscience weakened to the point where it happened several times
M’ahonim yɛɛ mmerɛw ara koduu baabi a esii mpɛn pii
Is such a situation hopeless ?	So wontumi nyɛ tebea a ɛte sɛɛ ho hwee ?
Not necessarily
Dabi ɛnte saa ankasa
What about Manasseh one of the kings of Judah ?	Na Manase Yuda ahemfo no mu biako no nso ɛ ?
He committed extremely serious sins including spiritism and child sacrifice
Ɔyɛɛ bɔne a anibere wom yiye a na ahonhonsɛmdi ne mmofra a wɔde wɔn bɔ afɔre ka ho
Yet God pardoned him on account of his sincere repentance
Nanso Onyankopɔn de firii no esiane adwensakra a efi komam nti
What about King David ?	Ɔhene Dawid nso ɛ ?
Having repented of his wicked acts he found Jehovah to be a God who is good and ready to forgive
Psalm
Bere a onuu ne ho wɔ ne nneyɛe bɔne ho no ohui sɛ Yehowa yɛ Onyankopɔn a oye na ɔde firi
’ Dwom
Christians today have this assurance If we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
Ɛnnɛ Kristofo wɔ saa awerɛhyem yi Sɛ yɛka yɛn bɔne kyerɛ a ɔyɛ ɔnokwafo ne ɔtreneeni sɛ ɔde yɛn bɔne befiri yɛn na watew yɛn ho afi nea ɛnteɛ nyinaa mu
’
To whom should one make this confession ?	Hena na ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka bɔne yi kyerɛ no ?
Primarily to Jehovah God
Yehowa Nyankopɔn titiriw
Before him pour out your heart
Munyi mo yam nkyerɛ no
You may find it helpful to read David s contrite confession in Psalm
Ebetumi aboa sɛ wobɛkan Dawid ahonu mpaemuka yi wɔ Dwom
Additionally the Bible urges Christians who have fallen into serious sin to speak with the congregation elders
Nea ɛka ho no Bible no hyɛ Kristofo a wɔayɛ bɔne a anibere wom sɛ wɔmmɔ asafo mu mpanyimfo no amanneɛ
Their earnest counsel and prayers can help you to reestablish your relationship with God and to regain a clean conscience
Wɔn afotu ne mpaebɔ a emu yɛ den no betumi aboa wo ma woasan ne Onyankopɔn anya abusuabɔ na woasan anya ahonim pa
They can discern the difference between weakness and wickedness
Wobetumi ahu nsonsonoe a ɛda mmerɛwyɛ ne nsɛmmɔnedi mpiyɛ ntam
They should also see to it that you get the help needed in order to avoid repeating your error
Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhwɛ hu nso sɛ woanya mmoa a ehia no na ama woakwati sɛ wobɛsan ayɛ saa bɔne no bio
Julie having taken this courageous step herself recommends I tried reproving myself and even thought it worked to an extent
Julie a ɔyɛɛ ade a egye akokoduru yi kamfo kyerɛ sɛ Mebɔɔ mmɔden sɛ mede nkaanim bɛma me ho ’ na misusuwii mpo sɛ edii dwuma koduu baabi
But after a year I knew how wrong I was
Nanso afe akyi no mihuu mfomso a madi
You can t clear up serious problems without help from the elders
Worentumi nni nsɛnnennen ho dwuma a worennye mmoa mfi mpanyimfo no nkyɛn
Guilt Over Minor Sins	Bɔne Nketenkete ho Afodi
Sometimes though a youth takes some false step before he is aware of it
Nanso ɛtɔ mmere bi a mfomso to abofra bi
’
Or he or she allows a fleshly compulsion to take over
Anaasɛ ɔma kwan ma bɔne ho atenka hyɛ ne so
A youth in this situation may suffer deep feelings of guilt perhaps more guilt than the wrong actually merits
Abofra a ɔwɔ saa tebea yi mu no bɛte afodi kɛse nka ebia afodi a ɛboro nea bɔne no ankasa de ba no
Needless anguish results
Ɛyawdi a ɛho nhia fi mu ba
Such profound guilt feelings can be the result of a healthy but overly sensitive conscience
Afodi ho nkate a ɛte sɛɛ no betumi ayɛ nea efi ahonim a ɛyɛ papa nanso nsɛm haw no ntɛmntɛm dodo
Remember when we sin we have a helper with the Father Jesus Christ a righteous one
John
Kae sɛ sɛ yɛyɛ bɔne a yɛwɔ okyigyinafo bi agya no nkyɛn ɔne ɔtreneeni Yesu Kristo
Yohane
Consider again the case of young Marco quoted in our introduction
Susuw abofra Marco a yɛfaa n’asɛm kae wɔ yɛn nnianim nsɛm no mu no ho bio
This young Christian was convinced that he had committed an unforgivable sin
Saa Kristoni abofra yi gye dii sɛ wayɛ bɔne bi a wɔmfa mfiri
He used to say to himself I know Bible principles so well yet I can t stop sinning ! 	Na ɔtaa ka kyerɛ ne ho sɛ Minim Bible nnyinasosɛm ahorow no yiye nanso mintumi nnyae bɔne yɛ ! ’
His sin ?	Bɔne bɛn na na ɔyɛ ?
The problem of masturbation
Boasipem
How can God forgive me if I can t break the habit ? 	 Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na Onyankopɔn de afiri me bere a mintumi nnyae adeyɛ no ? ’
Marco would reason
Marco susuwii saa
Alberto who similarly had bouts with self abuse said I felt the guilt deep down inside because I couldn t free myself of the sin
Alberto a na ɔde ne ho hyɛ boasipem mu saa ara nso kae sɛ Metee afodi nka wɔ me mu yiye efisɛ mantumi antwe me ho amfi bɔne no ho
Masturbation is an unclean habit
Boasipem yɛ suban a ɛho ntew
However the Bible does not class it with serious sins such as fornication
Nanso Bible no mmu no bɔne a anibere wom te sɛ aguamammɔ
In fact it does not mention it at all
Nokwarem no ɛmmɔ din koraa
Therefore a lapse into masturbation would hardly be unforgivable
Enti boasipem a wobɛsan de wo ho ahyem no renyɛ bɔne a wɔmfa mfiri
Viewing it as if it were beyond forgiveness could actually be dangerous a youth might reason that there is little point in trying to overcome the problem
Bu a wubebu no sɛ wontumi mfa mfiri betumi ayɛ nea asiane wom ankasa ebia abofra bi besusuw sɛ mmɔden a wobɛbɔ sɛ wubedi ɔhaw no so no yɛ nea ntease nnim ahe biara
But Bible principles indicate that a Christian should put forth strenuous efforts to fight this habit
Nanso Bible nnyinasosɛm kyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ Kristoni de mmɔdenbɔ a emu yɛ den ko tia su yi
Jehovah knows that we all stumble many times
Yehowa nim sɛ yɛn nyinaa fom nneɛma pii mu
If a relapse occurs a youth need not feel condemned
Sɛ abofra bi san yɛ bɔne bi bio a enhia sɛ ɔte nka sɛ wɔbɛsɛe no
The same is true of other missteps and errors
Saa ara na ɛte wɔ mfomso ne bɔne ahorow ho
Jehovah does not require that we punish ourselves with excessive guilt
Yehowa nhwehwɛ sɛ yɛde afodi ntraso bɛtwe yɛn ankasa ho aso
Rather he is pleased when we take steps to correct the problem
Corinthians John
Mmom sɛ yɛfa akwan horow so di ɔhaw no ho dwuma a n’ani gye
Korintofo Yohane
Sources of Help and Comfort	Mmoa ne Awerɛkyekye Fibea
Likely though you will need personal assistance in doing so
Nanso ɛda adi sɛ wubehia mmoa ankasa na woatumi ayɛ saa
God fearing parents can often do much to help and support their children
Mpɛn pii no awofo a wosuro Onyankopɔn betumi ayɛ pii de aboa wɔn mma
And the Christian congregation offers other means of support
Na Kristofo asafo no de mmoa foforo ma
Marco recalls The thing that really helped me was a conversation with an elder
Marco ka sɛ Ade a ɛboaa me titiriw ne nkɔmmɔ a me ne ɔpanyin bi dii no
I had to have courage to open up and tell him my most intimate thoughts
Na ɛsɛ sɛ minya akokoduru a ɛbɛma me ne no abɔ nkɔmmɔ na meka me komam asɛm kyerɛ no
But he inspired confidence so I asked his advice
Nanso ɔma minyaa awerɛhyem enti mesrɛɛ n’afotu
Alberto too sought advice from an elder
Alberto nso hwehwɛɛ mmoa fii ɔpanyin bi hɔ
I can t forget his encouraging counsel says Alberto
Alberto ka sɛ Me werɛ rentumi mfi ne nkuranhyɛ afotu no
He told me that when he was young he also had the same problem
Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no na ɔno nso wɔ ɔhaw a ɛte saa ara
I would never have believed it
Anka mennye nni da
I listened to him with great appreciation for his honesty
Esiane ne nokwaredi no nti mede anigye kɛse tiee no
With such help and support Marco and Alberto overcame their problems
Ɛdenam mmoa ne nkuranhyɛ a ɛtete saa so no Marco ne Alberto tumi dii wɔn nsɛnnennen no so
Both presently serve in positions of responsibility in their respective congregations
Mprempren wɔn baanu nyinaa som a wɔwɔ dibea ahorow a asɛyɛde wom wɔ wɔn asafo ahorow mu
Fervent prayer is another aid
Mpaebɔ a emu yɛ den yɛ mmoa foforo
Like David you can pray for a pure heart and a new spirit a steadfast one
Te sɛ Dawid no wubetumi abɔ mpae asrɛ koma a emu tew ne honhom foforo a ase tim
Reading God s Word is another source of comfort
Onyankopɔn Asɛm a wobɛkan no yɛ awerɛkyekye fibea foforo
For example you may find it encouraging to learn that the apostle Paul also had internal conflicts
Sɛ nhwɛso no wubetumi ahu sɛ ɛyɛ nkuranhyɛ sɛ wubehu sɛ na ɔsomafo Paulo nso di aperepere wɔ ne mu
He admitted When I wish to do what is right what is bad is present with me
Ogye toom sɛ Me a mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye no bɔne wɔ me hɔ
Paul succeeded in keeping his wrong tendencies under control
Paulo tumi dii ne bɔne su horow no so
So can you
Wo nso wubetumi ayɛ saa ara
You may find it particularly comforting to read the psalms especially those dealing with God s forgiveness such as Psalms and Ps
Wubehu sɛ ɛyɛ awerɛkyekye titiriw sɛ wobɛkan nnwom nhoma no nea ɛka Onyankopɔn fafiri ho asɛm te sɛ Dwom ne
In any event avoid withdrawing into yourself and letting yourself be dominated by pessimism
Ɔkwan biara so no kwati sɛ wobɛtew wo ho na wobɛma abasamtu adi wo so
Fully avail yourself of Jehovah s mercy
Nya Yehowa mmɔborohunu no mu mfaso kosi ase
Remember he forgives in a large way on the basis of Jesus ransom sacrifice
Kae sɛ ɔnam Yesu agyede afɔrebɔ no so de firi pii
’
Do not minimize your errors but do not conclude that God cannot forgive you either
Mmu wo bɔne no adewa bi nanso nka sɛ Onyankopɔn rentumi mfa mfiri wo nso
Strengthen your faith and your determination to serve him
Hyɛ wo gyidi ne wo bo a woasi sɛ wobɛsom no no mu den
In time you will come to have peace of mind and the deep inner joy of knowing that you have been forgiven
Compare Psalm
Bere kɔ so no wobɛba abenya asomdwoe adwene ne anigye wɔ wo mu denam hu a wubehu sɛ wɔde afiri wo no so
Fa toto Dwom ho

CORRESPONDENT IN ISRAEL	KYERƐWFO A ƆWƆ ISRAEL HƆ
JESUS stood before the Sanhedrin the highest court in Jerusalem on trial for his life
NA YESU gyina Sanhedrin asennibea kunini a ɛwɔ Yerusalem no anim a wɔrebedi n’asɛm akum no
Despite this pressure he fearlessly represented God s Kingdom
Na nhyɛso yi mfa ho ɔde akokoduru kaa Onyankopɔn Ahenni no ho asɛm
Within weeks of Jesus trial his closest followers stood before this same high court
Yesu asenni no akyi adapɛn kakraa bi no wɔde n’akyidifo a wɔbɛn no paa no kɔɔ asennibea kunini koro yi ara anim
There they gave a dynamic witness for God s Kingdom and its appointed King
Acts
Wɔde nnamyɛ dii Onyankopɔn Ahenni ne ne Hene a wapaw no no ho adanse wɔ hɔ

Days later when the apostles were once again haled before the Sanhedrin there was an unexpected turn of events
Nna bi akyi wɔde wɔn kɔɔ Sanhedrin no anim bio na asɛm bi a wɔnhwɛ kwan sii
Despite tremendous peer pressure Gamaliel one of the court s most respected members spoke out in behalf of Jesus disciples
Ɛmfa ho n’atipɛnfo nhyɛso a emu yɛ den no Gamaliel asennibea baguafo a wobu wɔn yiye no mu biako kasa maa Yesu asuafo no
As a result of this surprising intervention the apostles were set free
Acts
Ne ho a ɔde gyee asɛm no mu wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so yi ma wogyaee asomafo no
Asomafo no Nnwuma
These court appearances were in fulfillment of Jesus words at Matthew Look ! I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves
They will deliver you up to local courts
You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake for a witness to them and the nations
Asennibea a wɔde wɔn kɔe mpɛn pii no yɛ Yesu nsɛm a ɛwɔ Mateo no mmamu Hwɛ meresoma mo sɛ nguan akɔ mpataku mfinimfini

Though often misunderstood Jesus followers became well known throughout Israel
Ɛwom sɛ na wɔntaa nte Yesu akyidifo no ase de nanso wɔbɛyɛɛ nnipa a na wonim wɔn yiye wɔ Israel nyinaa
Thousands of first century Jews accepted Jesus message
Afeha a edi kan no mu Yudafo mpempem pii gyee Yesu asɛm no dii
All of this was a result of the zealous preaching of Jesus Jewish disciples including their fearless court appearances
Nnamyɛ a Yesu asuafo a wɔyɛ Yudafo no de dii adanse ne akokoduru a wɔdaa no adi mpɛn pii wɔ asennibea no na ɛde eyi nyinaa bae
In Israel today relatively few know of Jehovah s Witnesses who presently number less than in a nation of about million

But in the case of one young Witness not only brought considerable attention to their activity but also highlighted a unique historical link between prejudice and persecution that both Jews and Jehovah s Witnesses have suffered

How Did the Controversy Begin ?	Ɔkwan Bɛn so na Ntawntawdi no Fii Ase ?
Ariel Feldman a year old Jewish Russian immigrant to Israel living in Haifa was an honor student and well liked both by the school staff and by his fellow students
Ariel Feldman Yudani Russiani bi a wadi mfe a watu abɛtra Israel a ɔte Haifa no yɛ sukuuni a waben na sukuu no akyerɛkyerɛfo ne ne mfɛfo sukuufo no nyinaa pɛ n’asɛm yiye
As a result of a chance discussion on the street during the Persian Gulf War Ariel and his family began studying the Bible with Jehovah s Witnesses
Ɛdenam abɔnten so bɔnnɔ so nkɔmmɔbɔ bi so bere a na Persia Po Ko no rekɔ so no Ariel ne n’abusua fii ase ne Yehowa Adansefo suaa Bible no
Ariel made a thorough investigation and comparison of Jewish religious teachings and the Bible s explanations being presented to him by Jehovah s Witnesses
Ariel yɛɛ Yudasom mu nkyerɛkyerɛ ne Bible no mu nkyerɛkyerɛmu ahorow a onya fii Yehowa Adansefo hɔ no mu nhwehwɛmu na ɔde totoo ho
Serious minded Ariel made rapid progress in his study of the Bible and was the first member of his family to be baptized as one of Jehovah s Witnesses
Ariel a osusuw nsɛm ho anibere so no nyaa nkɔso ntɛmntɛm wɔ ne Bible adesua no mu na ɔne n’abusua no muni a odi kan a wɔbɔɔ no asu sɛ Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako
All of this presented no difficulty for him in his school studies
Eyi mu biara amma wanhyia ɔhaw bi wɔ ne sukuu adesua mu
In his senior year however his school decided to take on an experimental program to prepare students for army service
Nanso wɔ afe a ɔrebewie sukuu mu no ne sukuu no sii gyinae de dwumadi bi a wɔresɔ ahwɛ a ebesiesie sukuufo no ama sraadi kaa wɔn adesua ho
Soldiers gave instruction and the program included practicing combat positions and techniques
Asraafo na wɔde ɛho nkyerɛkyerɛ mae na wɔkyerɛ sɛnea wodi ako ne ɛho nyansakwan ahorow
Feeling that active participation in this course would violate his Bible trained conscience and his neutral stand as one of Jehovah s Witnesses Ariel made reasonable efforts to explain his position to the principal
Esiane sɛ Ariel tee nka sɛ ne ho a ɔde bɛhyɛ adesua yi mu no bɛma wabu n’ahonim a ɔde Bible atete no ne afa biara a onni sɛ Yehowa Adansefo mu biako no so nti ɔbɔɔ mmɔden faa ɔkwampa so kyerɛkyerɛɛ ne gyinabea mu kyerɛɛ sukuu sohwɛfo no
He respectfully explained that he was willing to take part in any other school activity during this period but that he could not act against his beliefs
Ofi obu mu kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ ɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho bɛhyɛ sukuu dwumadi foforo biara mu saa bere no nanso ontumi nyɛ biribi a ɛne ne gyidi nhyia
Although his school principal had previously shown some understanding toward him she decided that this request was more than she could allow
Ɛwom sɛ na ne sukuu sohwɛfo no anya ntease bi ama no bere bi a atwam de nanso osii gyinae sɛ ontumi mma saa adebisa yi ho kwan
She gave him an ultimatum Either actively participate in the premilitary training or be expelled from school

Ariel could not violate his conscience
Na Ariel ntumi mmu n’ani ngu n’ahonim so
On January just a few months before his final exams he was formally expelled from school with no alternative offered

Ariel turned to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel

They were willing to take on his case offering free legal assistance
Na wɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔbɛso n’asɛm no mu na wɔagyina n’akyi wɔ mmara kwan so a ontua hwee
The modern day Jewish State of Israel is a democracy
Nnɛyi Yudafo Man Israel no yɛ demokrase man
Although it has no constitution guaranteeing individual rights the Israeli declaration of independence promotes freedom of religion and freedom of conscience
Ɛwom sɛ wonni amammui mu mmara biara a ɛma ankorankoro bi nya hokwan ahorow de nanso Israel man no ahofadi mpaemuka no hyɛ nyamesom ne ahonim mu ahofadi ho nkuran
There was no legal precedent in Israel involving expulsion from school on grounds of religious belief
Na mmara mu ahwehwɛde biara nni Israel a ɛkyerɛ sɛ wotumi pam obi fi sukuu wɔ nyamesom mu gyidi ho
The newspapers began to take an interest in the story
Atesɛm nkrataa fii ase kyerɛɛ asɛm no ho anigye
Following legal advice Ariel did not grant interviews to reporters preferring to have his case judged in the courtroom rather than in the court of public opinion
Esiane sɛ na Ariel redi mmara kwan so afotu akyi nti wamma kwan ma nsɛnkyerɛwfo ammisabisa no nsɛm ɔpɛe sɛ wobedi n’asɛm no wɔ asennibea dan mu mmom sen sɛ wobedi wɔ amanfo adwenkyerɛ asennibea
However the school principal was quick to justify her actions in an interview
Nanso sukuu sohwɛfo no kyerɛe ntɛm so wɔ nsɛm a nsɛnkyerɛwfo bisabisa no mu sɛ nea ɔyɛe no teɛ
In the newspaper Hadashot of February she not only expressed her view that the student s religious stand was offensive to the State of Israel and all those who love it but used the opportunity to speak out against Jehovah s Witnesses as an organization saying Their activity is disguised filthy underhanded
Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔkyerɛɛ n’adwene wɔ atesɛm krataa Hadashot a ɛbae wɔ February no mu sɛ sukuuni no nyamesom mu gyinabea no haw Israel Man no ne wɔn a wɔwɔ ɔman no mu nyinaa nko na mmom ɔde hokwan no kasa tiaa Yehowa Adansefo sɛ wɔyɛ ahyehyɛde bi a sɛnea ɔkaa no no Wɔn dwumadi yɛ kokoam de ɛyɛ fi na wɔyɛ wɔ sum ase
They send out octopus arms and virtually hunt down the weak
Wotumi kɔ baabiara kɔhwehwɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ mmerɛw kyere wɔn
Many Israelis could see that the principal s views represented a prejudiced outlook
Israelfo pii tumi hui sɛ sukuu sohwɛfo no adwenkyerɛ ahorow no daa afoforo ho adwemmɔne a ɔwɔ adi
Tom Segev an Israeli journalist historian who has done much research on the Holocaust was especially disturbed by the interview
Nsɛnkyerɛwfo nkɔmmɔbɔ no mu nsɛm no haw Tom Segev Israelni bi a ɔyɛ sɛnkyerɛwfo ne abakɔsɛm kyerɛwfo a wayɛ Okunkɛse no mu nhwehwɛmu pii no titiriw
It reminded him of an attitude shown by some in Nazi Germany who spurred on by false accusations against the Jews vented their prejudice in one of the worst large scale crimes of mankind s history
Ɛmaa ɔkaee su bi a nnipa bi a na wɔwɔ Nasi Germany a atosɛm a wɔka guu Yudafo so kanyan wɔn ma wɔdaa wɔn adwemmɔne adi wɔ nsɛmmɔne kɛse a ɛyɛ hu sen biara a wɔadi wɔ abakɔsɛm mu no biako mu
Segev s opinion was that the greater danger to the State of Israel lay not in the young student s conscientious stand but rather in the example of intolerance shown by the school principal
Segev kyerɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɛnyɛ sukuuni kumaa no gyinabea a ofi ahonim mu apaw no ne ade a ɛyɛ asiane kɛse ma Israel Man no na mmom afoforo ho koma a wonni ho nhwɛso a sukuu sohwɛfo no ayi no adi no
He was moved to write an article defending the rights of Jehovah s Witnesses
Ɛkaa no ma ɔkyerɛw asɛm bi de gyinaa hokwan a Yehowa Adansefo wɔ akyi
See box page
Hwɛ adaka no kratafa
In the wake of Segev s article others also spoke out
Segev kyerɛw n’asɛm no akyi no afoforo nso kaa ho asɛm
One Jerusalem resident who because of being a Jew had been a prisoner in a camp during World War II wrote a letter to the editor recalling the fine conduct of Jehovah s Witnesses who were in the same camp because of their refusal to serve in the German army
Obi a ɔte Yerusalem a wɔde no too afiase wɔ Wiase Ko II mu esiane sɛ ɔyɛ Yudani nti kyerɛw krataa bi kɔmaa samufo no kaa Yehowa Adansefo a na ɔne wɔn da nneduaban biako mu esiane sɛ wɔansom wɔ Germany sraadi mu nti no suban pa ho asɛm
Since the young Witness student wouldn t accept interviews reporters turned to other congregation members
Esiane sɛ Ɔdansefo kumaa no ampene so sɛ ɔbɛma wɔabisabisa no nsɛm nti nsɛnkyerɛwfo dan kɔɔ asafo no mufo afoforo nkyɛn
Although not commenting specifically on Ariel s situation before it went to court they were happy to give out information on the beliefs of Jehovah s Witnesses and their activity in Israel
Ɛwom sɛ wɔanhyɛ da anka Ariel tebea no ho asɛm titiriw ansa na wɔde rekɔ asennibea de nanso wɔn ani gyei sɛ wotumi kaa Yehowa Adansefo gyidi ahorow ne wɔn dwumadi wɔ Israel ho asɛm kyerɛɛ wɔn
This led to a number of favorable articles in the Israeli press as well as a radio interview with one of the local elders
Eyi ma wɔkyerɛw nsɛm a eye wɔ Israel atesɛm nkrataa mu na wobisabisaa ɛhɔ mpanyimfo no mu biako nsɛm wɔ radio so
Many heard of Jehovah s Witnesses for the first time as a result of this unsolicited publicity

They requested the court to support their decision that under no circumstances should the student be allowed to set foot again on school property
Wɔsrɛe sɛ asennibea no nnyina wɔn gyinaesi sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔma sukuuni no kwan ma ɔba sukuu hɔ wɔ ɔkwan biara so no akyi
The civil rights lawyers presented the issue as a matter of basic rights of freedom of worship and freedom of conscience that had been violated by the school s handling of the matter
Ɔmanfo hokwan a wɔwɔ ho mmaranimfo no de asɛm no too gua sɛ sukuu no nam ɔkwan a ɛfaa so dii asɛm no ho dwuma no so asɛe ɔsom ne ahonim mu ahofadi hokwan atitiriw
The judges posed questions regarding the principles of Jehovah s Witnesses in order to understand the reason for the young student s stand
Atemmufo no bisabisaa Yehowa Adansefo nkyerɛkyerɛ ho nsɛm sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔbɛte nea enti a sukuuni kumaa no apaw saa gyinabea no ase
They also were presented with much information in the written petition regarding similar cases around the world in which high courts had decided in favor of Jehovah s Witnesses
Wɔde nsɛm pii a ɛfa nsɛm a ɛtete saa ho wɔ wiase nyinaa a asennibea akunini abu Yehowa Adansefo bem a ɛwɔ adesrɛde a wɔakyerɛw no mu maa wɔn
In their summation the judges stated that both sides were fighting for a principle
Awiei koraa no atemmufo no kae sɛ afanu no nyinaa redi apere wɔ nnyinasosɛm bi ho
However when weighing which side would suffer greater harm by leaving the situation as it stood it was definitely the student
Nanso bere a wɔhwehwɛɛ mu hwɛe sɛ ɔfa bɛn na sɛ wogyae asɛm no mu ma ɛka sɛnea ɛte no ara a ebepira no kɛse no wohui pefee sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sukuuni no
The judges expressed incredulity regarding the behavior of the principal and the Board of Education giving them ten days to explain their actions in writing
Atemmufo no annye nea sukuu sohwɛfo no ne Nhomasua Bagua no pɛe sɛ wɔyɛ no antom na wɔmaa wɔn dadu sɛ wɔmfa nkyerɛw nkrataa mmɛkyerɛkyerɛ wɔn nneyɛe no mu
The court issued an intermediate order requiring that Ariel Feldman be accepted back onto the school premises to finish out the school year and that he not be hindered from taking his final exams
Asennibea no de bere tiaa mu ahyɛde bi mae sɛ wɔnsan nnye Ariel Feldman mmra sukuu no mu ma onwie sukuu afe no a wonnsiw ne sɔhwɛ a etwa to a ɔbɛyɛ no ho kwan
Days before the final hearing which was set for May the Board of Education dropped their charges against Ariel Feldman
Aka nna bi ma wɔadi asɛm no nea etwa to a wɔde hyɛɛ May no Nhomasua Bagua no twee sobo a wɔde abɔ Ariel Feldman no sanee
As a result the final hearing was canceled the fundamental issues of the case were never decided by the court and no binding legal precedent was set
Ne saa nti wotwaa asenni a etwa to no mu na asennibea no ansi asɛm no nsɛmpɔw atitiriw ho gyinae na wɔanhyɛ mmara biara a ɛsɛ sɛ wodi so
Although this leaves the matter open to further legal debate Jehovah s Witnesses appreciated the reasonable attitude shown by the judges of the Israeli Supreme Court

The Lessons Learned	Asuade Ahorow a Yɛanya
From Jesus day till now Jehovah s Witnesses have met with opposition and prejudice that have brought them to the highest courts of many lands
Efi Yesu bere so besi nnɛ no Yehowa Adansefo ahyia ɔsɔretia na nkurɔfo anya wɔn ho adwemmɔne na eyi de wɔn akɔ asennibea akunini anim wɔ nsase pii so
These cases turn out to be a witness to the nations

Even when his Witnesses in a certain land are few Jehovah can see to it that his name becomes widely known
Sɛ n’Adansefo a wɔwɔ asase bi so yɛ kakraa bi mpo a Yehowa betumi ama ne din ahyeta
And just as was the case in the first century with the surprising intervention of the respected Sanhedrin member Gamaliel God today can raise up support for his people from unexpected sources

 In a nation that has everything there are also some Israeli Jehovah s Witnesses
Wɔ ɔman a ɛwɔ biribiara mu no Yehowa Adansefo a wɔyɛ Israelfo nso wom
They are not many and not many have heard about them despite the fact that in Israel as in every country they endeavor to gain followers to their principles by both the written word and orally

The principal didn t agree to release him from these lessons
Sukuu sohwɛfo no ampene so sɛ obeyi no afi saa adesua no mu
If I understood her correctly she sees him as a threat to the future of Zionism
Sɛ mete no ase yiye a ohu sukuuni no sɛ obi a obetumi asɛe Sionsom daakye
This week she explained to me We re a Zionistic school we teach the children loyalty to the State and to the nation

Rina Shmueli of the Citizen s Rights Association in Haifa tried to convince the principal to acknowledge the student s right to obey his conscience and release him from the premilitary training this could have been a very fitting lesson in tolerance and democracy

But she stood her ground

This reminded me of something not so good

So I called up the principal and asked her what she actually knew about Jehovah s Witnesses
Enti me ne sukuu sohwɛfo no kasae wɔ telefon so bisaa no nea onim wɔ Yehowa Adansefo ho ankasa
She said that she didn t know much but that she had heard that they re also active in other countries and she herself encountered them in Canada and Germany
Ɔkae sɛ onnim wɔn ho nsɛm pii na mmom wate sɛ wɔreyɛ adwuma denneennen wɔ aman afoforo so nso na ɔno ankasa hyiaa wɔn wɔ Canada ne Germany
I asked her if she knew what they did to them in Germany

I don t know and I also don t want to know the principal answered

 Perhaps the Hugim High School has a library and perhaps in that library they happen to have The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust edited by Israel Gutman

Of what use is a forked tongue to a snake ?	Dwuma bɛn na ɔwɔ de ne tɛkrɛma a ɛte sɛ adinam no di ?
According to a report in the International Herald Tribune the tongue helps the snake follow an aromatic trail in much the same way that our two ears work together to detect the direction of a sound

Many believe that the solution to this problem rests on the shoulders of the doctors themselves
Nnipa pii gye di sɛ ɔhaw no ano aduru gyina nnuruyɛfo no ankasa so

These Pretty Butterflies Are Poisonous ?	Awuduru wɔ Mfofantɔ a Wɔn ho Yɛ Fɛ Yi Mu ?
BY AWAKE !	EFI NYAN !
CORRESPONDENT IN SOUTH AFRICA	KYERƐWFO A ƆWƆ SOUTH AFRICA HƆ
HAVE you ever watched entranced as a butterfly fluttered by ?	WODE anigye ahwɛ afofantɔ a watu retwam pɛn ?
Were you impressed by its beauty its design and its colors ?	So w’ani gyee n’ahoɔfɛ ne yɛbea ne ne kɔla ahorow no ho ?
As it flits from flower to flower it seems to tantalize and tease you
Ɛte sɛ nea ɔreyi wo ahi bere a otu fi nhwiren biako so kɔ foforo so no
You would love to get a closer look maybe even a photograph but it never seems to stop long enough on any one bloom and it is always twitching its wings up and down
Ebia w’ani begye ho sɛ wobɛbɛn no ahwɛ no yiye anaa ebia wubetwa no mfonini mpo nanso ɛte sɛ nea onsi nhwiren a ahan biako so nkyɛ na ɔbɔ n’ataban mu ntoatoaso bere nyinaa
But did you know that some of these delightful creatures are believed to be poisonous ?	Nanso na wunim sɛ wogye di sɛ awuduru wɔ saa mmoa a wɔn ho yɛ anika yi bi mu ?
Let us take a look at the two on these pages the monarch on the right with its large black and orange brown wings and the viceroy above which looks almost identical to the monarch although it is usually smaller
Ma yɛnhwɛ abien yi a wɔwɔ saa nkratafa yi nkani nifa so a n’ataban yɛ akɛse tuntum ne nnodowee ne akokɔsrade ne akukua atifi hɔ a ɔreyɛ asɛ nkani no ɛwom sɛ ɔyɛ ketewaa mpɛn pii de
What makes them poisonous and what purpose does that serve ?	Dɛn na ɛma awuduru ba wɔn mu na edi atirimpɔw bɛn ho dwuma ?
Butterflies of which there are more than species go through four stages of development to become those delicate winged wonders that we see in our gardens
Mfofantɔ ahorow bɛboro no tebea sakra mpɛn anan ansa na wɔabɛyɛ mmoa a wɔn ntaban yɛ mmerɛw a wɔn ho yɛ anika a yehu wɔn wɔ yɛn aturom no
One of these is the larva or caterpillar stage
Tebea ahorow no mu biako ne ɔsa a ɔyɛ no
The monarch caterpillar feeds on the toxic milkweed and thus it is claimed that it becomes a truly toxic butterfly potentially deadly to any bird that eats one and doesn t vomit it back up writes Tim Walker in Science News
Tim Walker kyerɛw wɔ Science News mu sɛ nkani sa no di afifide bi a awuduru wom ma enti wɔkyerɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ afofantɔ a awuduru wɔ ne mu ankasa a ebetumi akum anomaa biara a ɔmene bi na ɔmfe ngu no
The poison is cardenolide a heart poison
Awuduru no yɛ aduru bi a ɛsɛe koma no
What about the viceroy butterfly ?	Na akukua afofantɔ no nso ɛ ?
Walker states For more than a century the conventional wisdom has held that this winged insect cloaks a very appetizing body behind the colors of a toxic monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus
Walker ka sɛ Bɛboro mfeha ni no na ntease a ɛwɔ hɔ ma wogye di kɛse sɛ saa akoekoeboa a ɔwɔ ntaban a ne kɔla te sɛ nkani afofantɔ Danaus plexippus a awuduru wɔ ne mu no nam yɛ dɛ yiye
As you can see from the photos the two butterflies have a very similar design except for the black inner line on the lower wings of the viceroy
Sɛnea wutumi hu fi mfonini ahorow no mu no mfofantɔ abien no yɛbea di nsɛ gye nsensanee tuntum a ɛwɔ akukua no ntaban a ɛwɔ fam no mu no
During the last years evolutionists have believed that the viceroy evolved a wing design similar to that of the poisonous monarch in an effort to avoid attacks from birds that had learned to keep away from this distasteful butterfly
Wɔ mfe a atwam no mu no na adannandifo gye di sɛ akukua no benyaa ntaban maa ne yɛbea bɛyɛɛ te sɛ nkani a awuduru wɔ ne mu no sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a nnomaa a wɔasua sɛnea wɔbɛtwe wɔn ho afi afofantɔ yi a ne nam nyɛ dɛ ho no nkyere no
Except for that it was believed the viceroy was appetizing to birds
Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a na anka wogye di sɛ akukua nam yɛ nnomaa dɛ
What have investigators recently discovered ?	Dɛn na nhwehwɛmufo ahu nnansa yi ?
Walker writes New research indicates however that the viceroy has successfully deceived scientists not birds
Walker kyerɛw sɛ Nanso nhwehwɛmu foforo kyerɛ sɛ nyansahufo na akukua no atumi adaadaa wɔn na ɛnyɛ nnomaa
Two zoologists have demonstrated that to discerning birds the viceroy can taste just as foul as the noxious monarch
Mmoa ho adenimfo baanu ada no adi sɛ wɔ nnomaa a wɔn ani atew fam no akukua no nam nyɛ dɛ te sɛ nkani a awuduru wɔ ne mu no ara pɛ
But why is the viceroy distasteful especially since its larvae eat nontoxic willows not toxic plants ?	Nanso dɛn nti na akukua no nam nyɛ dɛ titiriw esiane sɛ bere a ɔyɛ ɔsa no odi afifide a awuduru nnim no ?
Walker writes This suggests that viceroy butterflies somehow manufacture their own chemical defense
Walker kyerɛw sɛ Eyi kyerɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ akukua mfofantɔ ankasa yɛ nnuru de bɔ wɔn ho ban
In fact the present state of entomology suggests that the experts still have much to learn and should perhaps be less reliant on their conventional wisdom
Nokwarem no nimdeɛ a nkoekoemmoa ho adenimfo wɔ mprempren no kyerɛ sɛ wɔda so ara wɔ pii sua na ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho to ntease a ɛwɔ hɔ no so kɛse
One critic wrote this about a recent book on the monarch butterfly This remarkable book shows us that the more we learn about the monarch the less we know with confidence
Ɔkasatiafo bi kyerɛw eyi faa nhoma bi a ɛkaa nkani afofantɔ no ho asɛm nnansa yi no ho sɛ Saa nhoma nwonwaso yi kyerɛ yɛn sɛ bere a yesua nkani no ho ade pii no ne ho nimdeɛ ketewaa bi pɛ na yefi ahotoso mu tumi ka sɛ yenim

The first Christian on record to preach in Africa was himself an African the Ethiopian eunuch mentioned in the Bible at Acts chapter

Sɛ obi a wasakra abɛyɛ Yudani no Filipo maa no sakra bɛyɛɛ Kristoni bere a na wakɔsom wɔ Yerusalem asɔrefi hɔ na ɔnam kwan so rekɔ ne fie no
Without doubt in keeping with the zeal of early Christians this Ethiopian afterward actively preached the good news he had heard becoming a missionary in his own land

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church appears to date back to the fourth century when a Syrian student of philosophy named Frumentius was ordained as a bishop to Ethiopian Christians by Athanasius a bishop of the Coptic Church of Alexandria

Despite the major impact his and more years of Protestant missionary activity had on the country Catholics still outnumber Protestants by more than to
Ɛmfa ho sɛ ne mfe Protestantfo asɛmpatrɛw adwuma no nyaa ɔman no so tumi kɛse no Katolekfo da so ara dɔɔso sen Protestantni biara so
With increased Protestant participation however African missionary activity gained momentum

Adrian Hastings of the University of Leeds explains that the important legacy of this period second half of the th century was a significant start on translation of the Bible into scores of African languages

Bible translations in the vernacular provided a basis for spreading Christianity which had previously been lacking
Bible no a wɔkyerɛɛ ase kɔɔ ɔmanfo no kasa mu no ma wonyaa ade a wobegyina so atrɛw Kristosom mu ade a na wonni no kan no
Many Africans believed in dreams and visions viewed illnesses in terms of bewitchment and practiced polygamy
Afrikafo pii nyaa gyidi wɔ adaeso ne anisoadehu mu wobuu yare biara sɛ ahonhommɔne na wɔde ba na wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ aware dodow mu
Possessing the Bible in the vernacular gave Christendom s missionaries an opportunity to shed Scriptural light on these subjects
Bible no a wonyaa no ɔmanfo no kasa mu no maa Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo no nyaa hokwan de Kyerɛwnsɛm no kyerɛkyerɛɛ saa nsɛm yi mu
According to Hastings however Africans frequently remained unconvinced on these matters

The result ?	Dɛn na efi mu bae ?
 From the end of the nineteenth century a multitude of independent churches began to arise first in South Africa and Nigeria then in many other parts of the continent where there was already a significant missionary presence

Today in fact some new religious movements with over adherents exist in sub Saharan Africa

Obviously the missionaries failed to unify their converts in the one Lord one faith one baptism about which missionary Paul spoke

Why ?	Dɛn ntia ?
The source mentioned above explains that it was because of the disappointment of local converts with the premises and outcomes of Christianity
the perceived divisions in denominational Christianity and its failure to meet local needs and the failure of mission Christianity to break down social and cultural barriers and generate a sense of community
Nhoma a wɔbɔɔ din wɔ atifi hɔ no kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ na efi huammɔ a asɔre ahorow no ne nneɛma a Kristosom de ba dii ɛhɔfo a wɔasakra no

The amount of spiritual light Christendom s missionaries shed upon the Dark Continent was too little
Honhom mu hann a Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo daa no adi wɔ Esum Asasepɔn no so no nyɛ ahe biara
It was therefore too weak to dispel the darkness of Bible illiteracy
Enti na ano yɛ mmerɛw dodo sɛ ebeyi Bible mu nimdeɛ a wonni no ho sum afi hɔ
Agents of Colonialism ?	Abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi Ho Adwumayɛfo ?
Despite the fact that some of Christendom s missionaries accomplished good The Encyclopedia of Religion is forced to admit Missionaries both pressed for and facilitated the colonial takeover so that Christianity and colonial conquest could seem at times like two sides of a single coin
Ɛmfa ho sɛ Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo no mu bi yɛɛ ade pa no The Encyclopedia of Religion no mpɛ nanso egye tom sɛ Asɛmpatrɛwfo hyɛɛ abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi ho nkuran na wɔsan nso boae enti ɛtɔ mmere bi a na Kristosom ne abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi betumi ayɛ te sɛ ade koro
Modern anticolonialism has often branded Christianity in Africa with some justification as an accomplice of colonialism
Mpɛn pii na ɛnnɛyi abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi ho akasatiafo abɔ Afrika Kristosom ahohora a nokware bi wom sɛ ɛyɛ abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi bɔneyɛ boafo
The Collins Atlas of World History gives insight when it explains that Western nations were motivated by a conviction that colonization would bring the light of reason democratic principles and the benefits of science and medicine to those tribes of the interior that were thought of as primitive
The Collins Atlas of World History de nhumu ma bere a ɛkyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ gyidi bi a na Atɔe Fam aman wɔ sɛ aman no so abirɛmpɔnsɛm a wobedi no bɛma mmusuakuw a ɛwɔ kwaem a wosusuw sɛ wɔn ani mmuei no anya ntease kwasafo man ho nnyinasosɛm horow ne nyansahu ne aduruyɛ mu mfaso horow no na ɛhyɛɛ wɔn nkuran
And The New Encyclop dia Britannica states It has been difficult for the Roman Catholic missions to divorce themselves from colonialism and many missionaries did not want the divorce
Na The New Encyclop dia Britannica ka sɛ Ayɛ den ama Roma asɔre no sɛ ɛbɛtwe ne ho afi abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi ho na na asɛmpatrɛwfo no pii mpɛ sɛ wɔtwe wɔn ho
Logically then to the extent that Christendom s missionaries advocated democracy and praised the benefits of Western scientific and medical advancement they came across as agents of colonialism
Ɛnde ntease wom sɛ bere tenten a Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo kaa kwasafo amammui ho asɛm na wɔkamfoo mfaso horow a ɛwɔ Atɔe Fam nyansahu ne nnuruyɛ mu nkɔso kyerɛe no wɔdaa wɔn ho adi sɛ abirɛmpɔnsɛmdi ho adwumayɛfo

Preaching The First Priority ?	Asɛnka Ɛyɛ Ade a Edi Kan ?
Whenever mention is made of Protestant missionaries in Africa the name David Livingstone generally comes up
Bere biara a wɔbɛka Protestant asɛmpatrɛwfo a wɔbaa Afrika ho asɛm no wɔtaa bɔ David Livingstone din
Born in Scotland in he became a medical missionary and traveled extensively throughout Africa
Wɔwoo no wɔ Scotland wɔ mu na ɔbɛyɛɛ oduruyɛfo ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo na otuu kwan kɔɔ Afrika akyirikyiri baabiara
His deep love for the Dark Continent and the excitement of discovery provided him with additional motivation
Ɔdɔ a emu yɛ den a na ɔwɔ ma Esum Asasepɔn no ne nneɛma a ohui no ho anigye ma onyaa nkuranhyɛ foforo nso
The New Encyclop dia Britannica speaks of Christianity commerce and civilization as the trinity that he believed was destined to open up Africa
The New Encyclop dia Britannica ka Kristosom aguadi ne anibue ho asɛm sɛ ade abiɛsa a onyaa gyidi sɛ ɛbɛma Afrika ani abue
Livingstone s accomplishments were many
Na nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ Livingstone di ho dwuma no dɔɔso
His first priority however was evidently not preaching the gospel
Nanso ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ asɛmpa no ne ade a edi kan
The Britannica sums up his years of missionary work in southern central and eastern Africa often in places where no European had previously ventured this way Livingstone may have influenced Western attitudes toward Africa more than any other individual before him or since
Britannica no ka ne mfe mu asɛmpatrɛw adwuma wɔ Afrika kesee mfinimfini ne apuei fam a mpɛn pii no mmeae a na Europani biara nnii kan nkɔɔ hɔ no nyinaa ho asɛm wɔ saa kwan yi so sɛ Ebia Livingstone de Atɔe Fam nneyɛe horow no nyaa Afrika so nkɛntɛnso sen onipa foforo biara a odi n’anim anaa n’akyi
His discoveries geographic technical medical and social provided a complex body of knowledge that is still being explored
Nneɛma afoforo a ohui asase ho nsɛm mfiridwuma nnuruyɛ ne asetra mu nsɛm no de nimdeɛ a emu dɔ a wɔda so ara hwehwɛ mu bae
Livingstone believed wholeheartedly in the African s ability to advance into the modern world
Livingstone fii koma nyinaa mu nyaa tumi a na Afrika betumi de atu mpɔn abedu nnɛ wiase no mu gyidi
He was in this sense a forerunner not only of European imperialism in Africa but also of African nationalism
Wɔ ntease yi mu no na ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔne obi a odii kan wɔ Europa tumidi wɔ Afrika mu nko na mmom Afrikafo ɔmampɛ mu nso
Livingstone showed great compassion for the Africans
Livingstone daa ahummɔbɔ kɛse adi kyerɛɛ Afrikafo no
While some missionaries supported or at least condoned the slave trade it would be unfair to accuse them of having done so as a group
Esiane sɛ asɛmpatrɛwfo no bi na wɔboae anaa anyɛ yiye koraa no wɔpenee nkoatɔ so nti ɛrenyɛ papa sɛ yɛbɛbɔ wɔn sobo sɛ wɔn nyinaa yɛɛ saa
But whether the compassion many of them showed was motivated by a desire to uphold God s standards of impartiality and equality or more by normal feelings of personal concern about the welfare of individuals is in retrospect difficult to determine
Nanso sɛ ɔpɛ a wɔwɔ sɛ wobekura Onyankopɔn gyinapɛn ahorow a ɛfa nnipa anim a ɔnhwɛ ne nnipa nyinaa a obu wɔn pɛ ho mu anaasɛ atenka pa a wɔn ankasa wɔ wɔ ankorankoro yiyedi ho na ɛkaa wɔn mu pii ma wɔdaa ahummɔbɔ adi anaasɛ ɛnte saa no sɛnea yɛbɛka no no ɛyɛ den sɛ yebehu
The latter however would be in keeping with the priorities set by most of the missionaries
Nanso nea edi akyiri yi so na ɛbɛyɛ sɛ asɛmpatrɛwfo no mu pii gyina dii ahiade atitiriw ho dwuma
The book Christianity in Africa as Seen by Africans acknowledges that no one can match their record of humanitarian work
Nhoma Christianity in Africa as Seen by Africans gye tom sɛ obiara rentumi mfa ne ho ntoto wɔn kyerɛwtohɔ a ɛfa wɔn asetra mu yiyedi dwumadi ho ho
But building hospitals and schools meant putting human physical needs ahead of preaching God s Word in pursuit of divine interests

Some missionaries even set up trading posts to enable Africans to enjoy more European material goods thus improving their standard of living
Asɛmpatrɛwfo no mu binom mpo sisii aguadidan ahorow a ɛbɛma Afrikafo anya Europafo honam fam nneɛma pii na ama wɔn asetra atu mpɔn
Understandably many Africans are today grateful for the material benefits Christendom s missionaries made possible
Wɔ ntease pa mu no Afrikafo pii kyerɛ anisɔ wɔ honam fam mfaso horow a Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo no ma wonyae no ho nnɛ
As Adrian Hastings notes Even when most critical of missionaries and churches African politicians seldom fail to express gratitude for their contribution toward secondary education

For one thing the mortality rate among missionaries was high
Ade biako ne sɛ na asɛmpatrɛwfo no dodow a wowuwu no dɔɔso
Another factor was the involvement of Portugal in the slave trade
Ade foforo ne Portugalfo ho a wɔde hyɛɛ nkoatɔ mu no
Since all the Catholic missionaries were Portuguese this put the Christian religion in a very bad light
Esiane sɛ na Katolek asɛmpatrɛwfo no nyinaa yɛ Portugalfo nti eyi ma wonyaa adwemmɔne wɔ Kristosom ho
But more pertinent and perhaps more potent Kane adds were the superficial missionary methods which resulted in hasty conversions and mass baptisms

Christendom s missionaries failed to motivate Africans to replace their religions with the missionaries doctrines

According to Psalm the very disclosure of your God s words gives light making the inexperienced ones understand
Sɛnea Dwom kyerɛ no wo Onyankopɔn nsɛm mu bue ma hann ɛma nkwasea hu nyansa
Since Christendom s missionaries for the most part failed to give priority to disclosing God s Word what light could they give ?	Esiane sɛ Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo no mma Onyankopɔn Asɛm a wɔbɛka akyerɛ nyɛ wɔn ahiasɛm koraa nti dɛn hann na wobetumi de ama ?
Inexperienced ones remained without understanding

The light offered by Christendom s missionaries in past centuries their good works emanated from a world in darkness

In the two governments signed a treaty moving the line farther west

Making Converts	Nkurɔfo a Wɔsakra Wɔn
Christendom s missionaries began at first according to Rooy to uproot old rites and most external manifestations of Indian religion
Sɛnea Rooy kyerɛ no Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo no dii kan fii ase sɛ wobegu Indiafo nyamesom mu amanne dedaw ne emu nneyɛe dodow no ara ase
He added Although force was still used when necessary many Indians were converted by peaceful means through the direct approach of the priests
Ɔde kaa ho sɛ Ɛwom sɛ wɔhyɛɛ ebinom wɔ mmere a na ɛho hia mu de nanso asɔfo no kɔɔ Indiafo no nkyɛn tee kɔsakraa wɔn mu pii asomdwoe mu
Of course some missionaries believed force was never really justified
Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ na asɛmpatrɛwfo no binom gye di sɛ ɛmfata sɛ wɔhyɛ nkurɔfo ɔkwan biara so
For example a Spanish Dominican missionary and priest named Bartolome de Las Casas came to disapprove of the cruel methods used
Sɛ nhwɛso no Dominican ɔsɛmpatrɛwfo bi a na ɔyɛ ɔsɔfo a ofi Spain a wɔfrɛ no Bartolome de Las Casas ani annye atirimɔden akwan a wɔfaa so no ho
He repeatedly pleaded in Spain in behalf of the Indians for which reason the government gave him the title Defender of the Indians
Mpɛn pii na ogyinaa Indiafo no ananmu srɛ maa wɔn wɔ Spain aban anim ma enti aban no maa no abodin a ɛne Indiafo Akyigyinafo
His efforts met with mixed reactions however
Nanso ɛsono sɛnea obiara huu ne mmɔdenbɔ no
Some have called him a crusader a prophet a servant of God and a visionary others have called him a traitor a paranoiac an anarchist and a pre Marxist
Ebinom frɛɛ no mmeamudua ho ɔkofo odiyifo Onyankopɔn somfo ne ɔdehufo afoforo frɛɛ no ɔfatwafo ohufo otuatewfo Marx a odi kan
The goal of uprooting old rites was later discontinued

Once the natives had been pressured into accepting the name Christian they were permitted to retain their heathen beliefs and practices

The Cambridge History of Latin America explains that Mexican Indians took from Christianity those elements which suited their own spiritual and ritualistic needs and blended them with elements of their ancestral faith

True hundreds of thousands of Native Americans were baptized

But the Christianity imposed upon them was superficial at best
Nanso Kristosom a wɔde hyɛɛ wɔn no yɛ nea na emu nnɔ
Little time was spent teaching them the foundations of Christianity upon which to build a strong faith
Wɔannye bere pii amfa ankyerɛkyerɛ wɔ Kristosom nnyinaso ahorow a ɛso na wogyina nya gyidi a ɛyɛ den no
The Cambridge History of Latin America notes There were alarming indications that Indians who had adopted the new faith with apparent enthusiasm still venerated their old idols in secret
The Cambridge History of Latin America ka sɛ Na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛkyerɛ sɛ Indiafo a wɔagye ɔsom foforo no atom anigye so no da so ara som wɔn ahoni dedaw no kokoam
In fact some Indians reportedly placed pagan idols behind Christian altars in case the Christian God failed to respond

All these claims contained more than just a grain of truth

Throughout the New World according to The Encyclopedia of Religion conversion went forward as an arm of the colonial ventures of the Spanish French and English governments

Whereas Spain and Portugal concentrated on Latin America France and Britain were more involved in what later became the United States and Canada
Bere a na Spain ne Portugal de wɔn adwene sii Latin Amerika so no na France ne Britain redi dwuma wɔ nsase a akyiri yi ɛbɛyɛɛ United States ne Canada no so titiriw
Like those missionaries in Latin America the French and British missionaries set wrong priorities and became entangled in political matters

Thus notes The Encyclopedia of Religion by the close of the French era in Canada the missionaries had been more successful in making the Indians loyal to France than in converting them

It was thought that once converted the Indians would meekly deposit large quantities of gold

Christendom s missionaries did not obey Jesus instructions to make disciples

They were not united in the one faith

THE Catholic Church has tens of millions of adherents in Africa and its problems there are significant

The National Catholic Reporter told of the anguish of Catholic leadership

It said that the pope felt immense pain at fresh reports of conflict in the tiny African nation of Burundi whose population is predominantly Catholic

Since atrocities in Rwanda were being committed as the history making Catholic synod convened in Rome obviously the attention of the bishops was focused on the situation in Rwanda
Esiane sɛ na wɔreyɛ atirimɔdenne a ɛkɔɔ so wɔ Rwanda no wɔ bere koro no ara a na Katolekfo asɔfo mpanyin nhyiam titiriw no rekɔ so wɔ Rome nti ɛda adi sɛ asɔfo mpanyin no de wɔn adwene sii tebea a ɛwɔ Rwanda no so
The National Catholic Reporter observed The Rwandan conflict discloses something alarming Christian faith has not set down deep enough roots in Africa to overcome tribalism
National Catholic Reporter kae sɛ Rwanda ko no da biribi a ɛhaw adwene adi Kristofo gyidi nnyee ntini sɛnea ɛsɛ wɔ Afrika na ama adi mmusua mu nyiyim so
Noting the concern of the assembled bishops the National Catholic Reporter went on to say This theme of tribalism was tackled by Albert Kanene Obiefuna bishop of Awka Nigeria speaking to the synod
National Catholic Reporter reka nea ɛhaw asɔfo mpanyin a na wɔahyiam no ho asɛm no ɛkɔɔ so kae sɛ Albert Kanene Obiefuna a ɔyɛ Awka a ɛwɔ Nigeria no sɔfo panyin no kaa asɛm a ɛne mmusua mu nyiyim yi ho asɛm bere a ɔrekasa akyerɛ asɔfo mpanyin no
In his address Obiefuna explained The typical African lives the family life and also his Christian life in the context of his or her tribal work
Obiefuna kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu wɔ ne kasa no mu sɛ Afrikani gyina n’abusua mu asɛyɛde so na ɔbɔ ne bra sɛ abusua no muni ne sɛ Kristoni nso
Then no doubt with Rwanda in mind Obiefuna continued in his speech to the synod This mentality is so pervasive that the saying goes among the Africans that when it comes to the crunch it is not the Christian concept of the Church as a family which prevails but rather the adage that blood is thicker than water
Afei bere a ɛdaa adi sɛ Rwanda ho asɛm na ɛwɔ Obiefuna adwenem no ɔtoaa asɛm a ɔka kyerɛ asɔfo mpanyin no so sɛ Saa nsusuwii yi atrɛw araa ma Afrikafo ka sɛ sɛ tebea a emu yɛ den sɔre a ɛnyɛ Kristofo adwene a wokura sɛ Asɔre no yɛ abusua no akyi na wodi na mmom ɛbɛ a ɛne sɛ mogya mu yɛ duru sen nsu

And by water here one can presumably include the waters of Baptism through which one is born into the family of the Church
Na obi betumi de nsu a wɔka ho asɛm wɔ ha no aka Asubɔ mu nsu a wɔnam so wo obi ba Asɔre no abusua mu no ho
Blood relationship is more important even for the African who has become a Christian
Honam fam abusuabɔ ho hia Afrikani a wabɛyɛ Kristoni mpo kɛse
Thus the bishop admitted that in Africa the Catholic faith had been unsuccessful in creating a Christian brotherhood where believers truly love one another as Jesus Christ taught that they should
Ɔsɔfo panyin no nam saayɛ so gye toom sɛ Katolek asɔre no ntumi nhyehyɛɛ Kristofo onuayɛ bi a emu gyidifo dɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho sɛnea Yesu Kristo kyerɛe sɛ wɔnyɛ no wɔ Afrika
Rather blood relationship is more important to African Catholics
Mmom no honam fam abusuabɔ ho hia titiriw ’ ma Afrika Katolekfo
This has resulted in their putting tribal hatreds ahead of all other considerations
Eyi ama wɔde mmusua ho tan adi biribi foforo biara anim
As the pope acknowledged Catholics in Africa must bear responsibility for some of the worst atrocities in recent memory

Survival Said to Be at Stake	Wɔka sɛ Gyina a Ebegyina ho Aba Asɛm
African bishops at the synod expressed fears for the survival of Catholicism in Africa

If we want the Church to continue to exist in my country said Bonifatius Haushiku a Namibian bishop we must give very serious consideration to the question of inculturation

Expressing similar sentiments the Italian Catholic press agency Adista said To speak about inculturation of the Gospel in Africa means speaking about the very destiny of the Catholic Church in that continent of its chances of surviving or not surviving

Waliggo explained that adaptation is the term that has been used for a long time to signify the same reality
Waliggo kyerɛkyerɛɛ mu sɛ fakaayɛ ne asɛmfua a yefi bere tenten de ada nokwasɛm koro no ara adi
Put more simply inculturation means the assimilation of traditions and concepts of tribal religions into Catholic ceremonies and worship giving a new name and a new meaning to ancient rites objects gestures and places
Sɛ wɔka no tiawa a ɔsom afrafra kyerɛ mmusua nyamesom mu atetesɛm ne nsusuwii a wogye ka Katolekfo guasodeyɛ ahorow ne ɔsom ho din foforo ne nkyerɛase foforo a wɔde ma tete amanne ahorow nneɛma nsɛnkyerɛnne ne mmeae ahorow
Inculturation allows Africans to be Catholics in good standing and yet to hold on to practices ceremonies and beliefs of their tribal religions

The Italian newspaper La Repubblica for example asked Is it not true that in Europe Christmas was anchored to the festival of the Solis Invicti which fell on December ? 	Sɛ nhwɛso no Italiafo atesɛm krataa La Repubblica bisae sɛ Ɛnyɛ nokware sɛ wɔde Buronya gyinaa Solis Invicti afahyɛ a esi December no so wɔ Europa ? 
Indeed as Josef Cardinal Tomko prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples noted The missionary Church practiced the work of inculturation long before the term began to be used
Nokwarem no sɛnea Josef Cardinal Tomko Nnipa a Wɔsakra Wɔn Asafo sɔfopɔn no kae no Asɔre a ɛyɛ asɛmpatrɛw adwuma no de ɔsom ahorow frafrae bere tenten ansa na wɔrefi ase de asɛmfua no adi dwuma
The Christmas celebration illustrates the matter well as La Repubblica noted
Sɛnea La Repubblica kae no Buronya afahyɛ no kyerɛkyerɛ asɛm no mu yiye
Originally it was a pagan celebration
Mfiase no na ɛyɛ abosonsomfo afahyɛ
The date of December does not correspond to Christ s birth acknowledges the New Catholic Encyclopedia but to the feast of the Natalis Solis Invicti the Roman sun festival at the solstice
New Catholic Encyclopedia ka sɛ Ɛda a ɛne December ne Kristo awoda nhyia na mmom ɛne Natalis Solis Invicti Romafo owia afahyɛ wɔ bere a owia no mmɛn nkyɛmpɛ no koraa no apontow na ehyia
Christmas is only one of many church customs anchored in paganism
Buronya yɛ asɔre no amanne pii a egyina abosonsom so no mu biako pɛ
So are such beliefs as the Trinity immortality of the soul and eternal torment of human souls after death
Saa ara na gyidi ahorow te sɛ Baasakoro ɔkra a enwu da nnipa akra a wɔyɛ no ayayade wɔ owu akyi no te
John Henry Cardinal Newman of the th century wrote that the rulers of the Church from early times were prepared should the occasion arise to adopt or imitate or sanction the existing rites and customs of the populace
John Henry Cardinal Newman a ɔtraa ase wɔ afeha a ɛto so no mu no kyerɛwee sɛ na Asɔre no sodifo asiesie wɔn ho fi bere tenten sɛ sɛ hokwan no ba a wobegye wobesuasua anaa wɔbɛpene ɔmanfo no nneyɛe ne amanne ahorow

Listing many church practices and holidays he said they were all of pagan origin and sanctified by their adoption into the Church
Bere a ɔrebobɔ asɔre no nneyɛe ne nnapɔnna pii no din no ɔkae sɛ ne nyinaa fi abosonsom mu na wɔnam gye a wogye baa Asɔre no mu so tew ho
When Catholics enter non Christian areas such as parts of Africa they often find that people already have religious practices and beliefs similar to those of the church
Sɛ Katolekfo kɔ mmeae a Kristofo nni hɔ te sɛ Afrika afa horow a wɔtaa hu sɛ nnipa no wɔ ɔsom mu nneyɛe ne gyidi horow a ɛtete sɛ asɔre no de dedaw
This is because during previous centuries the church adopted practices and teachings from non Christian peoples and introduced them into Catholicism
Nea enti a eyi te saa ne sɛ wɔ mfehaha a atwam no mu no asɔre no gyee nneyɛe ne nkyerɛkyerɛ fii nnipa a wɔnyɛ Kristofo hɔ de baa Katoleksom mu
Such practices and teachings Cardinal Newman claimed were sanctified by their adoption into the Church
Ɔsɔfopɔn Newman kae sɛ nneyɛe ne nkyerɛkyerɛ a ɛtete saa a wogye baa Asɔre no mu no ma wɔtew ho

Thus when Pope John Paul II visited non Christian peoples in Africa last year he was quoted in L Osservatore Romano as saying In Cotonou Benin Africa I met the adherents of voodoo and it was evident from the way they spoke that in some way they already have in their mentality rites symbols and dispositions something of what the Church wants to offer them

They are only waiting for the time for someone to come and give them a hand to cross the threshold and live through Baptism what in some sense they were already living and experiencing before Baptism

Many like those sent to Greenland translated the Bible or parts of it into the vernacular
Te sɛ wɔn a wɔde wɔn kɔɔ Greenland no pii kyerɛɛ Bible no anaa n’afa horow ase kɔɔ ɔman no mu kasa mu

Christendom s missionaries to Japan for example were involved in educational institutions and schools notes the Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan
Sɛ nhwɛso no Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan ka sɛ Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo a wɔde wɔn kɔɔ Japan no tew asuae ne sukuu ahorow
It says A number of missionaries have distinguished themselves through their scholarship
Ɛka sɛ Asɛmpatrɛwfo dodow bi nam wɔn nhomanim so agye din
They became linguists or professors teaching subjects like literature language history philosophy East Asian religions and Japanese folklore
Wɔbɛyɛɛ kasa ho animdefo anaa abenfo wɔkyerɛɛ nneɛma te sɛ nhomakyerɛw kasa abakɔsɛm nyansapɛ Asia Apuei Fam ɔsom ahorow ne Japanfo amammerɛ
Charitable and social welfare institutions were also an important part of missionary work adds the encyclopedia
Encyclopedia no de ka ho sɛ Na adɔe ne asetra mu yiyedi nnwuma nso yɛ asɛmpatrɛw adwuma fa titiriw
Preaching the gospel did not have top priority with missionaries in general
Asɛmpatrɛwfo no dodow no ara ammu asɛmpaka no ade titiriw
Too often they emphasized the satisfying of physical needs rather than spiritual needs
Mpɛn pii no wosii honam fam ahiade ahorow a wobenya so dua sen honhom fam ahiade ahorow
Pursuit of personal interests became their focus

After centuries of Christendom s missionary activity in Africa what is the situation there ?	Bere a Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo de mfehaha pii ayɛ adwuma wɔ Afrika no tebea no te dɛn wɔ hɔ ?
In a report on the meeting of African bishops held this spring in Rome the German magazine Focus reported African religions are no longer to be condemned as heathen idolatry

Their members deserve esteem

In summary in their efforts to allay the problems of poverty poor health and lack of education Christendom s missionaries have as a group advocated human schemes that have at best brought only temporary and partial relief
Ne tiaatwa mu ara ne sɛ bere a Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo bɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛma ɔhaw ahorow a ɛne ohia akwahosan pa ne nhomasua a wonnya so atew no sɛ kuw no wɔagyina nnipa nhyehyɛe ahorow a aboro so koraa no nea ɛde aba ne ahotɔ kakra a ɛtra hɔ bere tiaa bi akyi
True Christian missionaries on the other hand direct people to God s established Kingdom which will bring lasting and total relief
Nea ɛne eyi bɔ abira no nokware Kristofo asɛmpatrɛwfo twe nkurɔfo adwene si Onyankopɔn Ahenni a wɔde asi hɔ a ɛde ahotɔ koraa a enni awiei bɛba no so
It will not just allay problems it will solve them
Ɛmmrɛ ɔhaw ahorow ase kɛkɛ ebedi ho dwuma
Yes God s Kingdom will bring to humankind perfect health genuine economic security unending opportunities of productive work for all and life without end ! Psalm Isaiah Revelation
Yiw Onyankopɔn Ahenni bɛma adesamma anya akwahosan a edi mu sikasɛm mu ahobammɔ ankasa hokwan ahorow a enni ano a ɛbɛma obiara anya adwuma pa ne daa nkwa ! Dwom Yesaia Adiyisɛm
Christendom s missionaries may point to professed Christians who occasionally attend religious services as proof that they have made disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them
Ebia Kristoman asɛmpatrɛwfo bɛtwe adwene asi wɔn a wɔkyerɛ sɛ wɔyɛ Kristofo a wɔkɔ asɔre bere ne bere mu no so sɛ adanse a ɛkyerɛ sɛ wɔayɛ amanaman nyinaa asuafo abɔ wɔn asu
’
But the facts show that these missionaries have failed to teach these baptized ones to observe all the things Jesus has commanded
Matthew
Nanso nokwasɛm ahorow no kyerɛ sɛ asɛmpatrɛwfo yi ankyerɛ wɔn a wɔabɔ wɔn asu yi sɛ wonni nea Yesu ahyɛ no nyinaa so
’ Mateo
However the teaching activity of true Christians will continue on into God s new world
Nanso nokware Kristofo ɔkyerɛkyerɛ adwuma no bɛkɔ so akodu Onyankopɔn wiase foforo no mu
It will reach out to embrace millions of resurrected ones who will need instruction in the ways of God
Ɛbɛka ɔpepem pii a wɔanyan wɔn a ɛho behia sɛ wɔkyerɛ wɔn Onyankopɔn akwan no
Then without satanic interference Christians will have the delightful privilege of continuing to make disciples even as they have been doing for decades

Naturally he had to lie about his comings and goings and about all the cash he was bringing home

Why They Rebel	Nea Enti a Wɔtew Atua
It is normal for youths to try to test their limits and to develop a measure of independence
Ɛyɛ mmofra su sɛ wɔbɛbɔ mmɔden ahu baabi a wobetumi ayɛ ade akodu na wɔanya ahofadi kakra
But rebellious outrageous and self destructive conduct is another thing entirely
Nanso atuatew ade a wɔyɛ ma ɛtra so ne ade a obi yɛ de sɛe ne ho no yɛ ade foforo koraa
What provokes it ?	Dɛn na ɛde ba ?
The reasons are many and varied
Nneɛma a ɛde ba no yɛ pii na egu ahorow
When you re young explains John you re looking for fun
John kyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Sɛ woyɛ abofra a wohwehwɛ anigyede
You want to have a good time
Wopɛ sɛ wugye w’ani
However because they lack experience in life young people do not always exercise the best judgment
Nanso esiane sɛ mmofra nni asetra mu osuahu nti ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na wɔde atɛmpa di dwuma
Sensible parents therefore impose reasonable restrictions on their children constraints that some youths fiercely resent
Enti awofo a wonim nyansa de anohyeto ahorow a ntease wom sisi wɔn mma anim anohyeto ahorow a mmofra binom pow denneennen
Sad to say some youths have even turned their back on the training that they received from God fearing parents
Nea ɛyɛ awerɛhow no mmofra binom adan wɔn akyi akyerɛ ntetee a wonya fii wɔn awofo a wosuro Onyankopɔn hɔ no mpo
Jesus said that Christianity would be a narrow and cramped way of life
Yesu kae sɛ Kristosom bɛyɛ asetra kwan bi a ɛyɛ teateaa ne hihiaa
So Christian youths often cannot do the things that their schoolmates do
Enti mpɛn pii na Kristofo mmofra ntumi nyɛ nneɛma a wɔn mfɛfo sukuufo yɛ
Most take restrictions in stride appreciating that God s laws are not really burdensome
Wɔn mu dodow no ara gye anohyeto ahorow tom na wɔkyerɛ anisɔ sɛ Onyankopɔn mmara nyɛ den ankasa
Indeed these laws protect youths from problems such as pregnancies out of wedlock drug abuse and sexually transmitted diseases
Nokwarem no saa mmara yi bɔ mmofra ho ban fi ɔhaw ahorow te sɛ nyinsɛn a wobenyinsɛn bere a wɔnwaree nnuru a wɔde bedi dwuma ɔkwammɔne so ne nyarewa a wonya fi ɔbarima ne ɔbea nna mu ho
But some youths refuse to see things that way they feel that Bible laws cramp their style
Nanso mmofra binom nnye ntom saa wosusuw sɛ Bible mmara ahorow to wɔn asetra ano hye
Resentment may run particularly deep if a youth feels his parents are overly rigid when it comes to such matters as discipline recreation and entertainment
Sɛ abofra bi susuw sɛ n’awofo yɛ katee dodo wɔ nteɛso ahomegye ne anigyede ho a ebia adwemmɔne a obenya no mu bɛyɛ den titiriw
I think my parents are being too strict with us lamented one young girl
Ababaa kumaa bi kae sɛ Misusuw sɛ m’awofo yɛ katee wɔ yɛn so dodo
True it can be disappointing when you are not allowed to do things that other Christian parents permit
Ampa ebetumi ayɛ abasamtu bere a wɔmma wo kwan mma wonyɛ nneɛma bi a Kristofo awofo afoforo ma ho kwan no
Some youths act out their frustrations by disobeying
Mmofra binom yɛ asoɔden de da wɔn abasamtu adi
On the other hand some youths deflect because their parents display no respect whatsoever for godly principles
Ɔkwan foforo so no mmofra binom fom kwan esiane sɛ wɔn awofonom nna obu biara adi wɔ Onyankopɔn nnyinasosɛm ahorow ho nti
Dad was an alcoholic recalls John
John ka sɛ Na Paapa yɛ ɔsadweam
He and Mom would argue because he drank too much

We moved several times to get away from him
Yetu kɔtraa mmeae ahorow mpɛn pii sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a yebefi ne nkyɛn
Alcoholics and other substance abusers simply cannot adequately care for their children s needs
Asadweamfo ne wɔn a wɔde nnuru afoforo di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so ntumi nni wɔn mma ahiade ahorow ho dwuma yiye ɔkwan biara so
In such homes verbal battering and humiliation may be a youth s daily lot
Wɔ afie a ɛtete saa mu no ebia wobedidi abofra bi atɛm agu n’anim ase daa
Other youths rebel because their parents in effect abandon them or ignore them
Mmofra afoforo tew atua esiane sɛ wɔn awofo gyaw wɔn anaasɛ wobu wɔn ani gu wɔn so ɔkwan bi so nti
Rebellion may seem like a way to get their parents attention or to hurt them
Ebia atuatew no bɛyɛ te sɛ ɔkwan bi a wɔnam so twe wɔn awofo adwene ba wɔn so anaasɛ wɔyɛ de pira wɔn
As far back as I can remember my parents never seemed to be around says a young girl named Taylor who comes from a wealthy family
Ababaa kumaa bi a ne din de Taylor a ofi abusua bi a wodi yiye mu ka sɛ Sɛnea metumi akae no ɛte sɛ nea na m’awofo nni fie bere nyinaa
You see I was an only child and since my parents weren t around that much they would always leave me with lots of money
Woahu na wodi me ɔba koro na esiane sɛ na m’awofo ntaa ntra fie nti na wogyaw me sika pii
Lacking supervision Taylor began attending nightclubs and getting drunk
Bere a obiara nhwɛ ne so no Taylor fii ase kɔɔ asanombea na na ɔbow nsa
It wasn t until her arrest for drunk driving that her parents realized she had a problem
Bere a wɔkyeree no sɛ ɔreka kar bere a wabow nsa ansa na n’awofo rehu sɛ ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi
In addition there is the situation pointed to by the apostle Paul when he asked a group of Christians You were running well
Who hindered you from keeping on obeying the truth ? 	Nea ɛka ho bio no tebea bi a ɔsomafo Paulo twee adwene sii so bere a obisaa Kristofo kuw bi asɛm yi no nso wɔ hɔ Mututuu mmirika yiye hena na osiw mo kwan sɛ munntie nokware no ?

Perhaps you too find yourself in a situation that seems frustrating or even oppressive
Ebia na wo nso wowɔ tebea bi a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ abasamtu anaasɛ ɛyɛ nhyɛso mpo mu
It may seem tempting to defy your parents and simply do what you want to do
Anhwɛ a wobɛte nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ w’awofo so asoɔden na woyɛ nea w’ankasa wopɛ sɛ woyɛ
But as the righteous man Job was warned take care that rage does not allure you into spiteful actions
Nanso sɛnea wɔbɔɔ ɔtreneeni Hiob kɔkɔ no mma abufuw nnnyigye wo nnkɔ ahiiyi mu
Be on your guard that you do not turn to what is hurtful
Job
Hwɛ yiye nnan w’ani nkɔ ahuhude so
Hiob
Spiteful outrageous behavior may get a reaction out of your parents but it is not likely to be a pleasant one
Ebetumi aba sɛ ahii a wubeyi ade a wobɛyɛ ma atra so bɛma w’awofo ayɛ biribi nanso ebia ɛrenyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye
If anything they will probably put you under more restrictions
Nea ɛbɛba mmom ne sɛ ebia wɔbɛma wo anohyeto pii
Furthermore hurtful behavior will cause your parents great pain
Afei nso suban bɔne a wubeyi no adi bɛma w’awofo adi yaw kɛse
Is that loving ?	So ɛno kyerɛ ɔdɔ ?
Will it really improve your situation ?	Ɛbɛma wo tebea no ayɛ yiye ankasa ?
A much more sensible approach is to talk matters over with them if you feel you have legitimate complaints
Ɔkwan a nyansa wom kɛse ne sɛ wo ne wɔn besusuw nsɛm ho sɛ wote nka sɛ wowɔ nsɛm bi a ɛfata a ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne wɔn ka a
They just may be willing to make some adjustments in the way they treat you
Ebia wɔn ani begye ho ankasa sɛ wɔbɛyɛ nsakrae wɔ sɛnea wɔne wo di nsɛm no mu
Another matter to consider is the effect your actions might have upon God
Ade foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho ne nea wo nneyɛe no betumi de aba Onyankopɔn so no
Upon God ? you may ask
Ebia wubebisa sɛ Onyankopɔn so ? ’
Yes because rebelling against your parents amounts to rebelling against God himself inasmuch as he is the one who commands you to honor your parents
Yiw efisɛ atua a wobɛtew atia w’awofo no te sɛ nea wotew atua tia Onyankopɔn ankasa efisɛ ɔno ne nea ɔhyɛ wo sɛ di w’awofo ni
How does such disobedience make God feel ?	Asoɔdenyɛ a ɛte saa ma Onyankopɔn te nka dɛn ?
The Bible says regarding the nation of Israel How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness
Ɛdefa Israel man no ho no Bible no ka sɛ Mpɛn ahe ara na wɔantew n’anim atua sare so
With what effect ?	Dɛn na efii mu bae ?
 They would make God feel hurt ! 	 Wɔhow Onyankopɔn werɛ ! ’
Granted you may be upset with your parents feeling that they are too restrictive
Ampa ebia wo bo afuw w’awofo na wote nka sɛ wɔyɛ katee dodo
But do you really want to bring pain to the heart of Jehovah God the one who loves you and wants you to live forever ? John Timothy

The High Price of Freedom 	 Ahofadi so Akatua a Ɛyɛ Yaw
With good reason then we need to listen to our loving heavenly Father
Ɛnde sɛnea ntease wom no ɛho hia sɛ yetie yɛn soro Agya a ɔwɔ ɔdɔ no
Do not be fooled by false promises of freedom

Fa toto Petro ho
It may seem that some youths do get away with misconduct
Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea mmofra binom yɛ bɔne a wonnya asotwe biara
But the psalmist warned Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers
Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness
For like grass they will speedily wither and like green new grass they will fade away

Says the Bible at Galatians Do not be misled God is not one to be mocked
For whatever a man is sowing this he will also reap

Consider Stan who was mentioned at the outset
Susuw Stan a yɛkaa ne ho asɛm mfiase no ho hwɛ
Just as he hoped he became popular with his unsavory friends
Sɛnea na ɔhwɛ kwan no obegyee din wɔ ne nnamfonom a na wɔn bra asɛe no mu
I felt accepted he recalls

He says I ve been shot jailed and now I am going to prison

What about John s search for freedom ?	Na ɛdefa ahofadi a John hwehwɛe no ho nso ɛ ?
After being arrested for drug possession he was expelled from the Christian congregation
Bere a wɔkyeree no sɛ okura nnuru a wɔde di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so no wɔpam no fii Kristofo asafo no mu
From there he sank into even more deviant behavior
Efi hɔ no ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ atuatew mu kɔɔ akyiri
I stole cars for money John confesses
John gye tom sɛ Miwiaa kar ahorow tɔn gyee sika
I was very violent
Na midi nsɛmmɔne paa
John made a lot of money from his criminal activities
John nam ne nsɛmmɔnedi no so nyaa sika pii
But he recalls I blew it all
Nanso ɔka sɛ Mesɛee ne nyinaa
The amount of dope we used was unbelievable
Sɛ yɛka nnuru a yɛde di dwuma no dodow kyerɛ wo a worennye nni
And when John wasn t fighting stealing or getting drunk he was running from the police
Bere a na John nko ntɔkwaw no na ɔrewia ade ɔrebow nsa anaasɛ ɔreguan polisifo
I ve been arrested about times

Usually they couldn t make any charges stick but once I did a whole year in jail
Mpɛn pii na wɔantumi ammɔ me sobo biara nanso bere bi wɔde me too afiase afe mu
Yes far from being a free man John found himself mired in the deep things of Satan

The same can be said for Elizabeth
Saa ara na yebetumi aka wɔ Elizabeth ho
Her fling with worldly friends eventually landed her in jail
Ne ho a ɔde bɔɔ wiasefo nnamfo denneennen no kowiee no afiasenna mu
She confesses I even became pregnant and because of my drug use I lost the baby
Ɔka sɛ Minyinsɛnee mpo na esiane nnuru a na mede di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so nti abofra no wui
Drugs were my life I seemed to live for my next high

Eventually I lost my apartment

I could not go home and I was ashamed even to ask Jehovah for help

The wise thing to do then is to try to get along with your parents discussing rather than rebelling against any restrictions you feel are unfair

The assailant robbed me but I was able to grab my son and escape

Immediately I prayed to Jehovah God to help me to be calm

I was also able to keep the assailant calm by quoting Bible texts to him
Menam Bible mu nsɛm a meka kyerɛɛ ɔkorɔmfo no so nso ma wanyɛ basabasa

Sadly the Tutsi neighbors were killed

However the others despite their efforts to save their friends were allowed to escape with their lives
Nanso ɛmfa ho sɛ afoforo no bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ wobegye wɔn nnamfo no nkwa no wɔmaa wɔn kwan ma woguan nyaa wɔn ti didii mu

Keeping Free From Ethnic Hatred	Mmusuakuw mu Nitan a Wɔkwati
That is not to say that Jehovah s Witnesses are totally immune to the ethnic hatreds that have existed for hundreds of years in this area of Africa
Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ Yehowa Adansefo ade wɔn ho koraa afi mmusuakuw mu nitan a atra hɔ mfehaha pii wɔ Afrika beae yi no ho
A Witness from France who was sharing in relief work noted Even our Christian brothers must put forth great effort to avoid being contaminated by the hatred which has contributed to massacres that are impossible to describe
Ɔdansefo bi a ofi France a na ɔrenya kyɛfa wɔ mmoa adwuma no mu kae sɛ Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nuanom Kristofo mpo yere wɔn ho kɛse na wɔamfa wɔn ho anhyehyɛ nitan a ama wɔakunkum nnipa pii a wontumi nkyerɛkyerɛ mu no mu
We met brothers who saw their families massacred before their eyes
Yehyiaa anuanom bi a wokunkum wɔn abusuafo wɔn anim
For example a Christian sister had been married just two days when her husband was killed
Sɛ nhwɛso no onuawa Kristoni bi waree akyi nnanu pɛ na wokum ne kunu
Some Witnesses saw their children and parents killed
Adansefo binom hui sɛ wɔrekunkum wɔn mma ne wɔn awofo
One sister who is now in Uganda saw her whole family slaughtered including her husband
Onuawa bi a ɔwɔ Uganda mprempren huu sɛnea wokunkum n’abusua mu nyinaa a ne kunu ka ho
This simply highlights the suffering both emotional and physical that has touched each family of Jehovah s Witnesses
Eyi yɛ nkate fam ne honam fam amanehunu a aka Yehowa Adansefo abusua biara ho nhwɛso
Altogether about Witnesses were killed in the ethnic violence
Sɛ wɔka ne nyinaa bom a Adansefo bɛyɛ na wokunkum wɔn wɔ mmusuakuw ntam basabasayɛ no mu
Yet none of these died at the hands of fellow Witnesses
Nanso eyinom mu biara anwu wɔ ne yɔnko Ɔdansefo nsa ano
Tutsi and Hutu members of Roman Catholic and Protestant churches however slaughtered thousands
Nanso Tutsifo ne Hutufo a wɔyɛ Roma Katolek ne Protestant asɔre ahorow no mufo kunkum nnipa mpempem pii
As is well documented Jehovah s Witnesses worldwide take no part whatsoever in the wars revolutions or other such conflicts of this world

Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees were seen streaming into neighboring countries and existing there under the most unsanitary conditions
Wohuu Rwanda aguanfo ɔpehaha pii sɛ wɔresen yuu akɔ aman a ɛbemmɛn hɔ no mu na wɔkɔtratra atrae a ɛhɔ ntew koraa
One of Jehovah s Witnesses on a relief mission from France described the situation his delegation saw on July as follows
Yehowa Adansefo no mu biako a ofi France bɛboae kaa tebea a ɔne ne mfɛfo adwumayɛfo kohui wɔ July no ho asɛm sɛnea edi so yi
We were confronted with scenes of absolute horror
Yehyiaa tebea ahorow a na ɛyɛ hu yiye
Mile after mile bodies lined the road
Na afunu deda kwan ho akwansini pii
Communal graves were filled with thousands of corpses
Wɔde afunu mpempem pii guguu nnipakuw adamoa mu
The stench as we went through the seething mass of people was unbearable with children playing next to dead bodies
Na yentumi nnyina pampan a yɛtee bere a yɛfaa nnipa pii a na wɔayɛ begyabegya mu no ano na na mmofra redi agoru wɔ afunu ho
There were corpses of parents whose children were still alive and were clinging to their backs
Yehuu awofo a wɔawuwu a na wɔn mma a wɔda so te ase hyehyɛ wɔn akyi afunu wɔ hɔ
Such scenes reproduced over and over again leave a deep impression
Tebea horow a ɛtete saa a yehuu no mpɛn pii no nyaa yɛn so tumi kɛse
A person is overwhelmed by a feeling of complete helplessness and he cannot remain unmoved by the extent of the horror and desolation
Ahude ne adesɛe kɛse no ma abasamtu a enni kabea bunkam obi so a ontumi ntra ase a ne werɛ nhow
When refugees by the tens of thousands were streaming into Zaire in mid July Witnesses in Zaire went to the border and held up their Bible publications so that their Christian brothers and interested ones could identify them
Bere a na aguanfo mpem du du pii resen yuu kɔ Zaire wɔ July mfinimfini mu hɔ no Adansefo a wɔwɔ Zaire no kɔɔ ɔhye no so na wɔmomaa wɔn Bible ho nhoma ahorow so sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔn nuanom Kristofo ne anigyefo betumi ahu wɔn
The refugee Witnesses from Rwanda were then gathered together and taken to the Kingdom Hall in nearby Goma where they were provided care
Afei wɔboaboaa Rwanda aguanfo a wɔyɛ Adansefo no ano na wɔde wɔn kɔɔ Ahenni Asa a ɛwɔ Goma a ɛbɛn hɔ no baabi a wɔhwɛɛ wɔn
Witnesses with medical experience worked hard to lessen the distress of the sick despite the absence of adequate medicines and proper facilities

Quick Response to Suffering	Amanehunu ho Ade a Wɔyɛ no Ntɛmso
On Friday July Jehovah s Witnesses in France received a faxed SOS from Africa
Wɔ Fida July no Yehowa Adansefo a wɔwɔ France nsa kaa nkra bi a egye ntɛmpɛ a wɔde hwehwɛ mmoa fii Afrika
It described the dire plight of their Christian brothers fleeing Rwanda
Ɛkaa wɔn nuanom Kristofo a wɔreguan fi Rwanda no amanehunu a emu yɛ den no ho asɛm
Within five or ten minutes of receiving the memo the brothers decided to load a cargo plane with relief supplies
Efi bere a wɔn nsa kaa nkra no akyi bɛyɛ simma anum anaa du pɛ no anuanom no sii gyinae sɛ wɔde ahiade begu wimhyɛn a ɛfa nneɛma mu
This led to a weekend of intense preparation which was all the more remarkable in view of their total lack of experience in mounting such a huge relief effort on short notice
Eyi maa wɔde ɔhyew boaboa nneɛma ano a na ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse titiriw esiane sɛ na wɔmmoaboaa nneɛma pii saa ano wɔ bere tiaa mu da nti
There was tremendous response to the need for relief funds

Witnesses in Belgium France and Switzerland alone contributed over

Relief materials were obtained including food medicine and survival equipment and everything was boxed and labeled at the facilities of Jehovah s Witnesses in Louviers France and in Brussels Belgium

Henri Tallet arrived in Goma about Witnesses had already died of cholera and others were dying daily
Bere a Oduruyɛfo Henri Tallet duu Goma Dwoda July no na kɔlera akunkum Adansefo bɛyɛ dedaw na na afoforo nso rewuwu da biara da
Because the shipment had to be delivered by way of Bujumbura Burundi some miles km away it didn t arrive in Goma until Friday morning July
Esiane sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nneɛma no fa kar twa kwan bɛyɛ kilomita fi Bujumbura Burundi nti ammedu Goma araa de kosii Fida anɔpa July
Coping With Disease	Yare Ano Gyina
In the meantime on the plot of land where the small Kingdom Hall in Goma was located some Witnesses and their friends were packed together
Saa bere no mu no na wɔaboaboa Adansefo bɛyɛ ne wɔn nnamfo ano wɔ asase a Ahenni Asa ketewa no si so wɔ Goma no so
For all these people there was one toilet no water and very little food
Baabi a wogya wɔn anan biako pɛ na na ɛwɔ hɔ ma saa nnipa yi nyinaa a na wonni nsu na aduan ketewaa bi pɛ na wɔwɔ
The dozens infected with cholera crammed into the Kingdom Hall
Wɔde nnipa pii a kɔlera ayɛ wɔn no kɔkyeree so wɔ Ahenni Asa no so
The death toll was escalating
Na nnipa a wɔrewuwu no redɔɔso
Cholera completely dehydrates a person
Kɔlera twe obi mu nsu nyinaa
The eyes become glassy and then roll upward
N’ani yɛ hyɛnn na afei aniwa tuntum no kɔhyehyem
If rehydration therapy is started in time the person is back on his feet in two days
Sɛ wɔde aduru bi a ɛma nipadua nya nsu ma no ntɛm a ne ho tɔ no wɔ nnanu akyi
Efforts therefore were immediately made to rehydrate the brothers with the little medicine that was available
Enti wɔbɔɔ mmɔden ntɛm ara de nnuru a ɛma nipadua nya nsu kakra a wɔwɔ no maa anuanom no
In addition brothers attempted to isolate the sick to prevent their contaminating others
Afei nso anuanom bɔɔ mmɔden yiyii wɔn a yare no ayɛ wɔn no fii afoforo no mu sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛrensan wɔn
They sought to transfer the refugees away from the terrible conditions in Goma
Wɔhwehwɛe sɛ woyi aguanfo no fi Goma tebea horow a ɛyɛ hu no mu
A suitable location was found near Lake Kivu away from the dust and the smell of corpses that hung heavy in the air
Wonyaa baabi a ɛfata wɔ Ɔtare Kivu ho beae a mfutuma nni na ɛmmɛn afunu pampan a agye mframa mu no
Toilets were dug and strict rules of hygiene were imposed
Wɔbɔɔ tiafi pii na wɔhyehyɛɛ ahotew ho mmara denneennen
These included washing one s hands in a bowl of bleach and water after going to the toilet
Nea ɛka eyinom ho ne obi nsa a ɔbɛhohoro wɔ ɔsɛn bi a aduru ne nsu wom mu bere a wakogya ne nan awie no
The importance of these measures was stressed and the people accepted what was required of them
Wosii hia a saa ahyɛde ahorow yi ho hia so dua na nkurɔfo no penee nea na wɔhwehwɛ fi wɔn hɔ no so
Soon the deadly tide of disease was turned
Ankyɛ na owuyare a na ɛretrɛw no ano brɛɛ ase
When the large shipment of relief supplies arrived on Friday July a little hospital was established at the Kingdom Hall in Goma
Bere a ahiade pii a wɔde faa po so hyɛn no beduu Fida July no wɔhyehyɛɛ ayaresabea ketewa bi wɔ Goma Ahenni Asa no so
Some camp beds were set up as well as a water treatment system
Wɔhyehyɛɛ mpa a wotumi bobɔ ne afiri a wɔde sɔn nsu so
In addition tents were taken to the Witnesses located on the banks of Lake Kivu
Nea ɛka ho no wɔde ntamadan kɔmaa Adansefo a wɔwɔ Ɔtare Kivu ano no
In a short while they had set up tents in neat orderly rows
Wɔhyehyɛɛ ntamadan a ɛsesa so fɛfɛɛfɛ bere tiaa bi akyi
At one time about Witnesses and their friends were seriously ill
Bere bi Adansefo ne wɔn nnamfo yaree denneennen
By the first week in August over of them had died in Goma
Eduu August dapɛn a edi kan mu no na wɔn mu bɛboro awuwu wɔ Goma
But medical supplies and assistance arrived in time to save many lives and to stop a great deal of suffering
Nanso wɔde nnuru ne nneɛma ahorow a wɔde boa baa ntɛm begyee nnipa pii nkwa na wosiw amanehunu pii ano
A Grateful Spiritual People	Honhom Mufo a Wɔwɔ Anisɔ
The Witness refugees showed extreme gratitude for all that was done for them
Adansefo aguanfo no kyerɛɛ anisɔ kɛse wɔ nea wɔyɛ maa wɔn no nyinaa ho
They were touched by the love shown by their Christian brothers in other countries and by the clear evidence that they truly belong to an international brotherhood
Ɔdɔ a wɔn nuanom Kristofo a wɔwɔ aman foforo so yii no adi ne adanse a ɛda adi pefee sɛ wɔka amanaman ntam onuayɛ bi ho no kaa wɔn kɛse
Despite their hardships the refugees have maintained their spirituality
Ɛmfa ho amanehunu a aguanfo no wom no wɔakura wɔn honhom fam yiyedi mu
In fact one observer noted that they seem more concerned to receive spiritual food than material help although they are in dire need of everything
Nokwarem no obi a ɔrehwɛ wɔn kae sɛ ɛwom sɛ wohia biribiara denneennen de nanso ɛte sɛ nea honhom fam aduan a wobenya ho hia wɔn sen honam fam mmoa
Upon request copies of the Bible study aid You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth in the Rwandan language of Kinyarwanda were shipped to the various refugee camps
Bere a wobisae no wɔde Wubetumi Atra Ase Daa wɔ Paradise wɔ Asase So nhoma a wɔde sua Bible no a ɛwɔ Rwanda kasa Kinyarwanda mu kɔɔ aguanfo atrae ahorow mu
The refugees considered a Bible text each day and they organized congregation meetings
Na aguanfo no susuw Bible mu asɛm bi ho da biara da na wɔyɛɛ asafo nhyiam horow ho nhyehyɛe
Arrangements were also made to conduct school classes for the children
Wɔyɛɛ sukuu adesua ho nhyehyɛe nso maa mmofra no
Teachers took advantage of these classes to give instruction on rules of hygiene emphasizing that survival depended on observing them
Akyerɛkyerɛfo de hokwan no kyerɛkyerɛɛ adesua akuw yi ahotew ho ade na wosii so dua sɛ nkwa mu a wɔbɛkɔ so atra gyina di a wobedi so so

Hundreds of Witness refugees were located in other places besides Goma such as Rutshuru
Sɛ yɛde Goma to nkyɛn a Adansefo aguanfo ɔhaha pii kɔɔ mmeae afoforo te sɛ Rutshuru
Similar aid was provided these brothers
Wɔde mmoa a ɛte saa ara maa saa anuanom yi
On July a Witness delegation of seven flew south from Goma to Bukavu where there were some Witness refugees
Wɔ July no Adansefo abɔfo baason bi de wimhyɛn fi Goma kɔɔ Bukavu wɔ kesee fam baabi a na Adansefo aguanfo bɛyɛ wɔ
Many of these were also from Burundi
Na eyinom mu pii nso fi Burundi
Cholera had broken out there and assistance was provided in an attempt to prevent any deaths among the brothers
Na Kɔlera asi wɔ hɔ na wɔbɔɔ mmɔden de mmoa mae hwehwɛe sɛ onua biara nwu
The following day the delegation traveled nearly miles km by road to Uvira Zaire where along the way there were about Witnesses in some seven locations from both Rwanda and Burundi
Da a edi hɔ no abɔfo no de kar twaa kwan a ɛreyɛ adu kilomita kɔɔ Uvira Zaire baabi a na Adansefo a wofi Rwanda ne Burundi bɛboro wowɔ kwan so bɛyɛ mmeae ahorow nson
Instruction was provided on how they could protect themselves from disease
Wɔde sɛnea wobetumi abɔ wɔn ho ban afi nyarewa ho nkyerɛkyerɛ maa wɔn
A report based on the findings of the delegation said What has been done thus far is just a beginning and the persons that are now receiving our assistance will need further help for many months
Amanneɛbɔ bi a egyina nea abɔfo no hui so ka sɛ Nea yɛayɛ de besi nnɛ no nyinaa yɛ mfiase ara kwa na nnipa a yɛreboa wɔn mprempren no behia mmoa foforo asram pii
Hundreds of Witnesses reportedly returned to Rwanda by August
Wɔbɔ amanneɛ sɛ eduu August no na Adansefo ɔhaha pii asan kɔ Rwanda
Yet practically all homes and belongings had been pillaged
Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔafow wɔn afie ne wɔn nneɛma nyinaa
So the challenge exists of reconstructing homes and Kingdom Halls
Enti adwumaden a ɛwɔ hɔ ne sɛ wobesisi afie ne Ahenni Asa ahorow
God s servants continue to pray fervently in behalf of those who have suffered so terribly in Rwanda
Onyankopɔn asomfo kɔ so bɔ mpae denneennen ma wɔn a wɔahu amane kɛse saa wɔ Rwanda no
We know that as the end of this system of things draws closer violence may increase
Yenim sɛ bere a nneɛma nhyehyɛe yi awiei bɛn kɛse no basabasayɛ bɛdɔɔso
However Jehovah s Witnesses worldwide will continue to maintain their Christian neutrality and to show their genuine compassion

What then is burnout ?	Ɛnde dɛn ne ɔbrɛ ntraso ?
Herbert Freudenberger and other researchers took up this term in the mid s and it came to describe a state of exhaustion resulting from involvement with people in emotionally demanding situations

Also physical or emotional exhaustion especially as a result of long term stress or dissipation

American Heritage Dictionary There are however depending on the researcher shades of difference in the definition of this term
American Heritage Dictionary Nanso nsonsonoe nketenkete wɔ sɛnea nhwehwɛmufo biara kyerɛ asɛm yi ase mu
Although burnout has no precise medical definition victims are identified by symptoms such as fatigue lack of enthusiasm helplessness hopelessness and malaise

The victim feels extremely tired and gets irritated over minor incidents

Nothing will ignite him to action

All efforts in the workplace and at home may seem pointless

If you have these symptoms coupled with malaise a lack of enjoyment in anything then you could well be experiencing burnout

When the situation seems out of hand stress becomes distress paving the way for burnout

Is burnout caused by overwork ?	Adwumayɛ bebrebe na ɛde ɔbrɛ ntraso ba anaa ?
Ann McGee Cooper a brain researcher said that burnout is the result of living out of balance typically in an all work no play spiral
Ann McGee Cooper amemene ho nhwehwɛmufo bi kae sɛ ɔbrɛ ntraso fi nneɛma a wɔyɛ tra so wɔ asetra mu a ɛtaa yɛ adwumayɛ bebrebe a ahomegye nnim
Overwork however is not the only factor under the same pressure and circumstances some burn out while others do not

Likely Victims of Burnout	Wɔn a Wobetumi Abrɛ Atra So
Just as there are people who are more likely to be infected with a certain disease there are types of people who are more likely to burn out
Sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɔyare bi betumi ayɛ nnipa binom no saa ara na nkurɔfo bi wɔ hɔ a wobetumi abrɛ atra so ntɛm
In order to suffer from burnout says Elliot Aronson professor of social psychology at the University of California you must first be on fire
Elliot Aronson a ɔyɛ nnipa nneyɛe ho ɔbenfo wɔ California Sukuupɔn mu ka sɛ Ansa na wobɛbrɛ atra so no na ɛkyerɛ sɛ wode wo ho ahyɛ biribi mu fee
So those prone to burn out are afire with high goals and ideals
Enti wɔn a wobetumi abrɛ atra so no de nnamyɛ di botae horow ne nsusuwii akɛseakɛse akyi
It is said that those who suffer burnout are often a company s best people
Wɔka sɛ wɔn a wɔbɔ mmɔden sen biara wɔ adwuma bi mu na ɔbrɛ ntraso taa ka wɔn
Summing up the personality traits of likely victims of burnout Professor Fumiaki Inaoka of the Japanese Red Cross College of Nursing wrote in the book Moetsukishokogun Burnout Syndrome Those who are inclined to burn out have strong tendencies to be sympathetic human delicate dedicated and idealistic

What companies need to do he said is find the people who care enough to burn out
and then develop programs to combat burnout

They eagerly try to help people giving of themselves to improve the lives of others and may burn out when they realize they are not achieving the sometimes unattainable goals they have set for themselves

Why People Burn Out	Nea Ɛma Ɔbrɛ Ntraso Ka Nkurɔfo
A survey taken among nurses revealed three factors leading to burnout
Nhwehwɛmu bi a wɔyɛe wɔ ayarehwɛfo mu daa nneɛma abiɛsa a ɛde ɔbrɛ ntraso ba adi
First noted was the amount of daily hassles causing frustration
Nea edi kan a wɔhyɛɛ no nsow ne da biara da mu ɔhaw ahorow a ɛde abasamtu ba
For example the majority of the nurses had to carry weighty responsibilities handle difficulties in dealing with patients adjust to new equipment face mounting expenses and put up with an irregular life style
Sɛ nhwɛso no na ayarehwɛfo no mu fa kɛse no ara di asɛyɛde a emu yɛ duru ho dwuma wodi ayarefo haw ahorow a emu yɛ den ho dwuma wosua sɛnea wɔde nnwinnade afoforo yɛ adwuma bobɔ ɛka akɛse na wogyina asetra a enni nhyehyɛe ano
These daily hassles constitute the greatest influence toward their burnout says the book Moetsukishokogun
Moetsukishokogun nhoma no ka sɛ Saa da biara da mu ɔhaw ahorow yi ne ade titiriw a ɛde ɔbrɛ ntraso ba
When problems remain unsolved frustration simply builds up and leads to burnout
Sɛ wɔanhwɛ anni nsɛnnennen ho dwuma a abasamtu kɛse na ɛba na ɛkowie ɔbrɛ ntraso mu
The second factor noted was lack of support not having someone to confide in
Ade a ɛto so abien a ɛde ba a wɔhyɛɛ no nsow ne mmoa a wonnya nya a wonnya obi nka wɔn tirim asɛm nkyerɛ no
Thus a mother who isolates herself from other mothers is more likely to burn out
Enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse sɛ ɛna bi a ɔtew ne ho fi ɛnanom afoforo ho bɛbrɛ atra so
The above mentioned survey found that single nurses are more prone to burn out than those who are married
Nhwehwɛmu a wɔaka ho asɛm wɔ atifi hɔ no daa no adi sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ayarehwɛfo asigyafo bɛbrɛ atra so sen wɔn a wɔaware
Nonetheless being married can increase daily hassles if there is no open communication between husband and wife
Nanso sɛ obi yɛ ɔwarefo na sɛ nkɔmmɔbɔ ankɔ so wɔ okunu ne ɔyere ntam a ebetumi ama da biara da mu ɔhaw ahorow adɔɔso
Even when everyone is home a person may find himself alone because his family is absorbed in watching television
Sɛ obiara wɔ fie mpo a obi betumi ate ankonamyɛ nka esiane sɛ n’abusuafo ani abere rehwɛ television nti
The third factor was feelings of helplessness
Ade a ɛto so abiɛsa a ɛde ba ne basaayɛ
For instance nurses are more likely to experience feelings of helplessness than doctors because nurses may lack the authority to change things
Sɛ nhwɛso no ayarehwɛfo botow ntɛm sen nnuruyɛfo efisɛ ebia ayarehwɛfo nnya tumi a wɔde sakra nneɛma
Those in middle management may burn out when they feel their greatest efforts are not taking them anywhere
Wɔn a wɔde wɔn asisi nnwuma so betumi abrɛ atra so bere a wɔte nka sɛ mmɔden a ɛsen biara a wɔbɔ no nkosi hwee no
As a human resources manager said burnout comes from being frustrated by trying to make an impact and not being listened to
Sɛnea nnipa dom akyɛde ho nsɛm panyin bi kae no nea ɛde ɔbrɛ ntraso ba ne abasamtu a obi nya fi mmɔden a ɔbɔ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne fam de na wɔnyɛ aso mma no no mu
Feelings of helplessness in humans germinate in a soil of unappreciative attitudes and bear the fruit of burnout
Nnipa taa botow bere a wɔnkyerɛ wɔn ho anisɔ na nea efi mu ba ne ɔbrɛ ntraso
Wives burn out when their husbands fail to acknowledge the amount of work involved in homemaking and taking care of the children
Ɔyerenom brɛ tra so bere a wɔn kununom nkyerɛ adwuma a wɔyɛ de siesie fie de hwɛ mmofra no ho anisɔ no
The middle managers burn out when a boss ignores a job well done and picks on them for minor mistakes
Wɔn a wɔde wɔn asisi nnwuma so brɛ tra so bere a wɔn panyin bi bu n’ani gu adwuma pa bi a wɔayɛ so na ɔka wɔn anim wɔ mfomso nketenkete bi ho no
The bottom line is that we all need to have our efforts appreciated and acknowledged says Parents magazine and if we work in a place that does not reward our efforts be it our home or our office then we re more likely to suffer from burnout
Parents nsɛmma nhoma no ka sɛ Ade a ɛho hia titiriw ne sɛ yɛn nyinaa hia sɛ wɔkyerɛ yɛn mmɔdenbɔ ahorow ho anisɔ na sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma wɔ baabi a wɔnkamfo yɛn mmɔdenbɔ ahorow sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn fie anaa yɛn adwuma mu a ɛnde ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ yɛbɛte ɔbrɛ ntraso nka
Interestingly while nurses experience high percentages of burnout obstetricians suffer considerably less
Nea ɛyɛ anika no bere a ayarehwɛfo taa brɛ tra so no ɛntaa mma saa wɔ awogyefo fam
Generally speaking an obstetrician s work involves helping new lives come into the world
Mpɛn pii no ɔwogyefo adwuma ne sɛ ɔbɛboa ma ateasefo afoforo aba wiase
Mothers and fathers thank them for their work
Ɛnanom ne agyanom da wɔn ase wɔ wɔn adwuma no ho
When appreciated people feel that they are useful and are motivated
Sɛ wɔkyerɛ nkurɔfo ho anisɔ a wɔte nka sɛ wɔn ho hia na ɛkanyan wɔn
As soon as one knows who tends to burn out and why it becomes easier to deal with the problem

Burnout How Can You Cope ?	Ɔbrɛ Ntraso Wobɛyɛ Dɛn Agyina Ano ?
BURDENED with stress from anxieties and daily hassles many try to drink away their frustrations
BERE a dadwen ne da biara da mu ɔhaw ahorow ma adwennwen hyɛ nnipa pii so no wɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛnom nsa de agyina wɔn abasamtu ano
Alcohol the most widely abused drug today is used by many in an attempt to escape hard realities
Nnipa pii de mmosa a ɛyɛ aduru a wɔde di dwuma ɔkwammɔne so sen biara nnɛ di dwuma de bɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkwati asetra mu ɔhaw ahorow
Others have relied on popular prescription drugs to deal with anxieties
Ebinom nso de nnuru a wɔtaa kyerɛw ma nkurɔfo di dwuma de gyina dadwen ano
Yet others resort to mind altering drugs such as marijuana methamphetamines and cocaine
Afoforo nso dan kɔ nnuru a enya adwene so tumi te sɛ wii nnuru bi a wɔfrɛ no methamphetamine ne cocaine so
Even young children have been known to use drugs to escape the realities of life
Wɔahu mmofra bi mpo a wɔde nnuru adi dwuma sɛ wɔde rekwati asetra mu ɔhaw ahorow
It is said that percent of American youths will have used one or more illegal substances before they graduate from high school
Wɔka sɛ Amerika mmofra ɔha biara mu de aduru a mmara mma ho kwan biako anaa nea ɛboro saa di dwuma ansa na wɔawie ntoaso sukuu
Then there are those who try to escape daily stress by going on sprees with their friends or putting on a masquerade of cheerfulness while feeling depressed inside
Afei nso yɛwɔ nkurɔfo a wɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔbɛkwati da biara da mu adwennwen denam nneɛma a wɔne wɔn nnamfo yɛ ma ɛtra so anaa wɔn ho a wɔyɛ te sɛ nea wɔn ani gye nanso wɔn mu tɔnn no wɔwɔ abasamtu no so
Or for the wrong reasons they seek the affection and tenderness of the opposite sex
Anaasɛ ebia ntease ahorow a ɛnteɛ nti wɔhwehwɛ ɔdɔ ne akorɔkorɔ fi wɔn a ɛsono wɔn bɔbeasu hɔ
But using escapist measures to deal with stress only increases frustration
Nanso nneɛma a wɔyɛ de brabra adwennwen so ma abasamtu yɛ kɛse mmom
When people try to dilute stress with alcohol or other mind altering substances rather than rekindling themselves they speed up the process of burnout

Oduruyɛfo Yutaka Ono a ɔyɛ ɔpanyin wɔ Keio Sukuupɔn Aduruyɛ Suabea no kamfo nneɛma abiɛsa a ɛma wogyina ɔbrɛ ntraso ano kyerɛ
He explains The three C s stand for control communication and cognition
Ɔkyerɛkyerɛ mu sɛ Nneɛma abiɛsa ’ no ne ahosodi nkitahodi ne ntease
In order to overcome feelings of helplessness you must be able to feel you are in control of your feelings and behavior
Nea ɛbɛyɛ na woatumi adi basaayɛ so no ɛsɛ sɛ wutumi te nka sɛ wutumi di wo nkate ne wo nneyɛe so
When frustration daily dominates your emotions and crushes your capacity to solve problems it is easy to believe things are out of your hands
Sɛ abasamtu di wo nkate so da biara ma enti wuntumi nni nsɛnnennen ho dwuma a ɛnyɛ den sɛ wubegye adi sɛ tebea no agye wo nsam
However do not just sit back and dwell on troublesome thoughts

Try to solve your problem step by step

Do not procrastinate

Just by initiating positive actions you will begin to feel better and in control

Try to reduce irritations that result in defeatist feelings
Bɔ mmɔden tew abufuw a ɛde abasamtu ba so
For instance some tend to get annoyed by every trifle in life
Sɛ nhwɛso no asetra mu ade ketewa biara tumi hyɛ ebinom abufuw
They insist on a certain way of doing things and get irritated when others do not comply or they may become frustrated by their own failures
Wɔhyɛ sɛ wɔmfa ɔkwan pɔtee bi so nyɛ nneɛma na sɛ afoforo anyɛ saa a wɔn bo fuw anaasɛ ebia wɔn nkogudi ahorow bɛma wɔn aba mu abu
Do not become righteous overmuch an ancient wise man said nor show yourself excessively wise
Tete barima nyansafo bi kae sɛ Nyɛ wo ho ɔtreneeni bebrebe na nyɛ onyansafo ntra so ɛdɛn nti na wobɛsɛe wo ho ? 
Why should you cause desolation to yourself ? Clinging to standards that are too high and constantly feeling you are not measuring up to them is a sure way to burn out
Gyinapɛn ahorow a ɛkorɔn dodo a wobɛbata ho na woate nka bere nyinaa sɛ wuntumi nnuu ho no yɛ ɔkwan titiriw a ɔbrɛ ntraso betumi afa so aka wo
Further helpful counsel from the Bible is to be modest in walking with your God
Afotu foforo a ɛboa a efi Bible mu ne ahobrɛase a wode ne wo Nyankopɔn nantew
To be modest means to be aware of one s limitations or to place a moderate estimate on one s abilities
Sɛ obi bɛbrɛ ne ho ase kyerɛ sɛ obehu ne mmerɛwyɛ ahorow anaa onsusuw ne mmɔdenbɔ ahorow ho ntra so
This may mean saying no to unreasonable demands at the workplace
Eyi betumi akyerɛ sɛ wobɛpopo wo ti wɔ nneɛma a wɔhwehwɛ fi wo hɔ a ɛtra so wɔ adwumam no ho
Those who know their limitations welcome help
Wɔn a wohu wɔn mmerɛwyɛ ahorow gye mmoa tom
One female manager who had experienced burnout said that the key to avoiding it is to ask for help
Ɔbea bi a na ɔyɛ adwuma mu panyin a na ɔbrɛ ntraso aka no pɛn kae sɛ ade a ɛbɛboa ma woakwati ne sɛ wobɛsrɛ mmoa
Still as she says a lot of people are afraid to ask for help because they may be looked upon as failing in their job
Nanso sɛnea ɔka no nnipa pii suro sɛ wɔbɛsrɛ mmoa efisɛ ebia wobebu wɔn sɛ wontumi nyɛ wɔn adwuma
Be it housework schoolwork or secular work whatever is threatening you with burnout delegate work where you can
Sɛ ɛyɛ ofie adwuma sukuu adwuma anaa honam fam adwuma biribiara a ebetumi ama woabrɛ atra so no fa nnwuma no bi hyɛ afoforo nsa bere a wubetumi ayɛ saa
You will be surprised to see how things get accomplished without your directly managing everything
Compare Exodus

You may need some rest

A leave of absence can work miracles for a potential victim of burnout
Akwamma betumi adi aboa obi a ɔbrɛ ntraso reyɛ aka no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so
However if your circumstances do not allow for that if you know how to have fun it makes a difference says researcher Ann McGee Cooper
Nanso nhwehwɛmufo Ann McGee Cooper ka sɛ sɛ wo nsɛm tebea mma ɛno ho kwan a sɛ wunim ɔkwan a wobɛfa so agye w’ani a ɛboa
Taking a break for a change of pace may even increase productivity stimulating your mind toward creative thinking

It is interesting that fire fighters rarely experience burnout

He then showed that one necessary condition for meaning is the attachment to something larger than you are
Afei ɔkyerɛe sɛ ade biako a ɛho hia na ama woanya atirimpɔw ne sɛ wobɛbata biribi a ɛkorɔn sen wo ho
Although many people today do not take their relationship with God seriously communication with the Creator who is certainly larger than you are can help you to cope with feelings of helplessness

Kae Nnipa a ɛnyɛ den sɛ ɔbrɛ ntraso bɛka wɔn ne wɔn a wɔwɔ gyinapɛn ahorow a ɛkorɔn na wosusuw afoforo ho
What is most helpful for a burnout victim is a word of appreciation
Nea ɛbɛboa obi a wabrɛ atra so asen biara ne sɛ wɔbɛka asɛm de akyerɛ ne ho anisɔ
It will make a big difference to a mother if her husband and children express and show appreciation for all the work involved in running a household
Sɛ ɛna bi kunu ne ne mma ka sɛ wɔn ani sɔ adwuma a ɔyɛ de hwɛ fie no nyinaa na sɛ wɔyɛ ade de kyerɛ saa a ɛde nsakrae kɛse bɛba
If a middle manager suffers burnout at work an appreciative comment and a pat on the back can change his outlook for the good
